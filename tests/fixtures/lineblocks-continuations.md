| Line blocks are useful for addresses,
| verse, and 
  adornment-free lists.
| 
| Each *new* line
  begins
  with a 
| vertical bar ("\|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents
|     are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped
  portions of long lines; they begin with
  spaces in place of vertical bars.
