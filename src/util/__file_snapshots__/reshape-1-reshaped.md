# Figure, table and chunk captions

The reshape function attempts to combine tables, figures and code chunks and their captions.

## Tables

table: Table 1
:::
Caption starts with Table number.

| A | B |
| - | - |
| 1 | 2 |
:::

The caption can be after e.g.

table: Table 2
:::
Caption after table

| A | B |
| - | - |
| 3 | 4 |
:::

Captions can also be indicated by emphasis or string emphasis e.g.

table:
:::
Caption for the next table

| A | B |
| - | - |
| 3 | 4 |
:::

## Figures

figure: Figure 1
:::
![](https://example.org/image.png)

Caption after after image
:::

figure:
:::
![](https://example.org/image.png)

Caption is above and bold
:::

## Chunks

For formats such as Word and Google Docs placing the figure caption outside of the chunk (and image in those cases). Allows users to more conveniently edit them.

chunk: Figure 3
:::
The caption for the code chunk.

```r
# Some R code
```
:::

## Citations

Remove unnecessary parentheses and brackets around singular parenthetical citations ([@ref]) and \[[@ref]] and citation groups ([@ref1; @ref2]) and \[[@ref1; @ref2]] (these can cause duplication if left). 

Group together citations surrounded by parentheses to avoid them being treated as narrative (@ref) and (@ref1, @ref2) and (@ref1; @ref2, @ref3). Note that true narrative citations e.g. @ref should not be affected.

Detect numeric citations like \[1], \[2] (and \[3]) including those referring to a non-existent reference e.g. \[101] and those within marked inline content e.g. _\[1]_ bu ignoring "plain text" as in a code fragment e.g. `[2]`. Can also deal with groups of numeric citations e.g. \[1,2] and \[2, 3].

Note the need for escaping the leading square bracket because we are in Markdown and they must not be confused with links.

Also detects citations within tables e.g.

| Column 1 | Column 2 (@ref1) |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| @ref2    | @ref3 (@ref4)    |
