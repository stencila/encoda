description: >-
  Psychological and personality factors, socioeconomic status, and brain
  properties all contribute to chronic pain but have essentially been studied
  independently. Here, we administered a broad battery of questionnaires to
  patients with chronic back pain (CBP) and collected repeated sessions of
  resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans.
  Clustering and network analyses applied on the questionnaire data revealed
  four orthogonal dimensions accounting for 56% of the variance and defining
  chronic pain traits. Two of these traits—Pain-trait and Emote-trait—were
  associated with back pain characteristics and could be related to distinct
  distributed functional networks in a cross-validation procedure, identifying
  neurotraits. These neurotraits showed good reliability across four fMRI
  sessions acquired over five weeks. Further, traits and neurotraits all related
  to the income, emphasizing the importance of socioeconomic status within the
  personality space of chronic pain. Our approach is a first step in providing
  metrics aimed at unifying the psychology and the neurophysiology of chronic
  pain applicable across diverse clinical conditions.

        Unraveling mechanisms of chronic pain remains a major scientific
        challenge. There is now strong and convincing evidence that specific
        brain properties contribute to the risk of developing chronic pain and
        that the transition to chronic pain involves brain adaptations that, to
        a large part, construct and mold the state of chronic pain [

        ]. Additionally, current theories suggest that pain characteristics,
        pain-related disability, and responses to treatment are all partially
        determined by psychological factors and/or personality properties [

        target: pbio-3000349-ref003

        ]. Although the biopsychosocial (BPS) perspective is actively applied in
        the everyday clinical management of chronic pain [
      - type: Cite

        ], component properties that comprise the concept—namely biological
        processes (brain and body), psychological factors, and the impact of
        social factors on these components—have rarely been jointly studied.
        Thus, the relative influence of these factors on each other, as well as
        their independent contribution to the state of chronic pain, remains
        unknown. In its current form, the BPS model is built on fragmented
        evidence taken from different disciplines, and—remarkably—lacks
        integration between psychosocial components and underlying biology. Even
        though subgroupings of chronic pain types by psychological dimensions
        have been repeatedly formulated [

        ], a systematic approach of linking such concepts with brain biology
        has, to our knowledge, not been undertaken. Here, we unravel and
        interrelate components of BPS by combining psychological, personality,
        and SES factors with measures of resting state functional connectivity
        to begin to define a unified perspective of chronic pain.

        There is a large body of literature demonstrating that psychological and

        disability [

        considered better predictors of chronic pain disability than the actual
        injury itself [

        ]. Despite their pivotal role in chronic pain, a comprehensive
        multidimensional characterization of psychological and personality
        factors in chronic pain remains unexplored. The first aim of the current
        study was therefore to determine how the psychological factors believed
        to impact persisting pain interacted with general personality factors to
        give rise to factors that define chronic pain traits, in a chronic back
        pain (CBP) cohort.

        The neurobiological underpinnings of chronic pain psychology/personality
        also remain relatively unknown, as few studies have examined the
        association between such factors (usually focusing on pain
        catastrophizing) and brain functional properties. For instance, pain
        rumination has been associated with stronger functional connectivity
        between the medial prefrontal cortex and regions within the default mode
        network (DMN) in temporomandibular disorder [

        content:
          - '23'
      - >-
        ]. In migraines, seed-based analyses show that pain catastrophizing is
        associated with functional coupling between several brain regions
        (posterior cingulate cortex with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
        the insula with the hippocampus) [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref024
        content:
          - '24'
      - >-
        ]. In fibromyalgia, pain catastrophizing has been associated with
        increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in anticipation of
        pain [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref025
        content:
          - '25'
      - >-
        ]. However, these studies tested limited psychological parameters in
        association with brain properties from only a few predefined regions of
        interest. Here, our secondary aim was to decode traits of chronic pain
        using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging
        (fMRI), with the goal of determining if and how chronic pain traits are
        represented in patterns of brain activity, bridging the psychology of
        pain with its neurobiological framework, which we define as neurotraits.
        Thus, our primary hypothesis was that chronic pain traits can be
        determined from distributed neural representations.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        Our third aim was to determine the influence of social components on
        traits and neurotraits by examining the association of SES with these
        dimensions. Many studies show that lower SES is associated with higher
        prevalence of musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, ulcers, and
        sciatica across Europe and North America [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref004
        content:
          - '4'
      - >-
        ]. Consistently, the British Birth Cohort study revealed that lower SES
        during adulthood is associated with shoulder, forearm, low back, knee,
        and chronic widespread pain [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref026
        content:
          - '26'
      - >-
        ]. Consistent with the BPS model, SES and occupational hazards are
        important risk factors for the onset of back pain and pain disability,
        independent of injury occurrence or type [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref027

        ]. We therefore hypothesized that SES measured with self-reported
        income, years of education, sex/gender, and race/ethnicity will be
        linked to the traits and underlying neurobiology.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:

        Our results indicate four dimensions comprising chronic pain traits,
        only two of which were associated with back pain characteristics of CBP.
        We therefore studied brain functional connectivity networks for these
        two dimensions and demonstrate that they can be represented from
        distributed functional networks (neurotraits). These networks were
        reliable in repeat brain scans. Confirming our starting hypothesis, SES
        was associated with chronic pain traits and their related functional
        networks.

            A. The study design consisted of six visits to the lab, with four of
            these including brain imaging sessions. Questionnaires were
            administered at V1 and pain was manipulated with placebo treatment
            (T1) followed by a washout period (W1), repeated twice (T2, W2).
            Sixty-two patients completed all six visits (Group 1) and 46
            patients completed the questionnaires at V1 but did not finish the
            rest of the study (Group 2). B. Each covariance matrix (Group 1 and
            Group 2; ordered based on PCA results for Group 1) showed
            associations between the questionnaire outcomes used to probe CBP
            patients’ profiles (

        We first sought to define the psychology/personality factors of chronic
        pain based on responses to a broad battery of questionnaires in two CBP
        cohorts (Group 1 and Group 2;

        matrix constructed from responses to questionnaires that surveyed
        concepts related to chronic pain; constructs of personality; and
        emotional, attentional, and motivational properties, all of which are
        thought to influence traits of chronic pain. We profiled the CBP
        patients using the following measures: pain anxiety (PASS), pain
        catastrophizing (PCS), pain sensitivity (PSQ), pain acceptance (CPAQ),
        emotion regulation (ERQ), attentional capacities (ACS), attentional
        capacities in the presence of emotions (EACS), optimism (LOT-R),
        sensitivity and aversion to loss (LAQ), positive affect (PANAS/p),
        interoceptive awareness capacities (MAIA), mindfulness capacities (FFM),
        and personality traits (NEO-5: neuroticism, extraversion, openness,
        conscientiousness, and agreeableness). The associations among subscales

        We used Group 1 data to construct a network from the covariance matrix
        of 36 subscales. This network exhibited high-dimensional topology, as
        community clustering of the subscales segregated into four distinct
        communities (

        ). PCA analysis applied on the covariance matrix for Group 1 also
        identified four orthogonal principal components with eigenvalues > 2.0
        and explained more than 5% of the variance (representing the elbow in
        the scree plot,

        ). The four components together explained 56% of the variance. PCA
        performed for Group 2 data identified the same four components as seen
        for Group 1 data, explaining 57% of the variance, validating the four
        dominant psychological dimensions related to chronic pain. These
        components are dubbed “chronic pain traits,” which we label based on the
        component loadings. Component 1, Pain-trait, was dominated by factors
        emphasizing the psychological toll of chronic pain: high positive
        loadings for fear of pain, pain catastrophizing, and pain anxiety and a
        high negative loading for pain acceptance. Component 2, Character-trait,
        included mainly positive personality traits such as extraversion,
        conscientiousness, and openness. Component 3, Aware-trait, included
        various awareness capacities and abilities to regulate emotions.
        Component 4, Emote-trait, included diminished neuroticism, lower
        sensitivity to loss, high optimism, strong attentional control in the
        presence of emotion, and high aptitude for mindfulness. Similar results
        were obtained in Group 2, for which the PCA identified the same four
        domains with factor loadings similarly as seen in Group 1 (

        ). Although network and PCA analyses resulted in similar results, there
        were also subtle differences in the components identified by each
        procedure; thus, we use both representations in subsequent analyses.
        Overall, we identify four validated dimensions comprising traits of
        chronic pain in CBP patients. Unsurprisingly, the obtained pattern
        indicates that pain-related properties comprise the dominant dimension,
        while the other three dimensions comprise positive domains of character,
        awareness, and emotion, all of which would theoretically counterbalance
        or modulate the primarily negative pain-related dimension.

        We examined the interrelationship between the four trait dimensions of
        chronic pain with the intensity, qualities, and negative affective
        characteristics of the back pain experienced by our CBP patients. Our
        aim was to link specific traits to pain aspects of CBP. In both groups,
        we assessed back pain and pain-related negative affect using
        questionnaires and ratings. The pain intensity measurements included a
        series of numerical scales: out-of-clinic ecological momentary
        assessments (EMAs) of back pain intensity entered twice a day using
        smartphone technology, a verbal recall of the pain experienced over the
        last seven days (Memory) and an in-lab numeric rating scale (NRS) of the
        current pain. Pain qualities were assessed using the McGill pain
        questionnaire—sensory (MPQ/s) and affective (MPQ/a) subscales—and
        PainDetect. Negative mood and depressive symptoms were assessed using
        the negative affect score from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale
        (PANAS/n) and the Beck Depression Index (BDI-1a). Finally, physical
        health was also evaluated (12-item short-form survey/physical health
        [SF-12p]). The absolute levels in these pain measurements were
        equivalent between the two groups with the exception of SF-12p that was
        higher in Group 1. Baseline levels for these measurements are presented
        for both groups in

        almost all clinical measurements capturing back pain properties at V1
        and V2, while Emote-trait was anticorrelated primarily to the negative
        affective characteristics of CBP (

            trait with back pain intensity (EMAs, Memory, NRS), quality (MPQs/a,
            PainDetect), and negative affect (PANAS/n, BDI). A. In group 1,
            Pain-trait scores were related to almost all pain characteristics
            queried at V1 and V2, while Emote-trait scores were negatively

        cross-validation procedure, for which patients were divided into
        training (2/3 of patients) and testing (1/3 of the patients) sets. The

        weighted negative links: mainly between sensorimotor, DMN, memory,
        visual, frontoparietal, and ventral attention communities (Neurotrait

        weighted positive links: between DMN, visual, sensorimotor, salience,

        Pain-trait and Emote-trait being independently associated with negative

        be related with responses to treatment. In the current study, we
        explored how the traits related to the response to placebo pills in the
        settings of a RCT. We calculated the magnitude of placebo response as
        the strongest response (% change in pain) in either of the two treatment

        unrelated to pain measurements are still relevant when studying other
        characteristics of patients, such as the likelihood of responding to a
        specific treatment.

        Current work is aimed towards defining the psychological/personality
        traits of chronic pain and integrating these properties with brain
        function. We identified four chronic pain traits, which accounted for
        about 60% of the variance generated across a high-dimensional
        personality/psychology space (36 subscales from 13 questionnaires),
        validated in a separate sample. Only two of these traits were associated
        with the pain characteristics, in specific and opposing patterns. These
        traits were used to identify underlying brain circuitries (neurotraits),
        which were relatively stable over multiple weeks. Identified traits and
        neurotraits showed an association with socioeconomic
        factors—specifically, income—with the patients reporting higher income
        being more protected. Thus, our study provides a characterization of the
        chronic pain patient along psychological, neurobiological, and social
        dimensions, all underpinning specific traits and their derived brain
        networks.

    content:

        Here, we advance a novel approach for deriving multivariate dimensions
        of chronic pain. By interrogating patients within a high-dimensional
        personality/psychology space—spanning the domains of attitudes toward
        pain (acceptance, catastrophizing, anxiety, sensitivity), interoceptive
        awareness, emotional regulation, and attentional control, mindfulness
        skills, personality (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
        neuroticism, and openness), optimism, motivation (loss aversion), and
        positive affective state—and then applying dimensionality reduction
        techniques (cluster and network analyses), we uncover primary chronic
        pain traits and expound on their properties. Given that the
        dimensionality reduction methods used here depend on the input parameter
        space and the size of the population used, obtained results remain
        somewhat arbitrary and one worries about missing critical dimensions.
        Nevertheless, our ability to validate the effects of traits on chronic
        pain measurements in an independent group of patients and show that the
        uncovered neurotraits were relatively stable across four consecutive
        brain scans enhances confidence that the studied dimensions are robust,
        meaningful, and biologically grounded characteristics at least for
        neuropathic chronic back pain.

        The current study systematically delineates the state space of the
        biopsychosocial model for chronic pain. In this regard, the specific
        terminology that we invoke aims to highlight the limits of the
        biopsychosocial model as explored here. Although the biopsychosocial
        model has been advocated for over 30 years and is widely used in
        clinical pain settings (mainly in multidisciplinary pain management
        programs) [

        Here, we begin to better understand and depict the critical
        biopsychosocial elements for CBP. Components of Pain-trait are all
        considered fundamental constituents of the biopsychosocial model. They
        have been repeatedly shown to be important contributors to chronic pain,
        and even seem to determine the analgesic efficacy of diverse therapies
        (topical or oral analgesics, cortisone and other injectables, surgical
        outcomes, and psychosocial treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy)
        [

        ]. The next two factors, Character-trait and Aware-trait, reflect
        positive character as well as awareness and emotional regulation traits
        and showed no consistent relationship with back pain properties. The
        fourth, Emote-trait factor, reflects higher optimism, mindfulness
        capacities, and lower neuroticism and loss aversion, and it was
        inversely related with negative affect. Thus, factors 2–4 seem to
        counterbalance the aversive toll of chronic pain (factor 1) and as such
        may be an important compensatory mechanism that patients use to tolerate
        the persistent CBP state (diminishing their perceived disability while
        living in chronic pain). From this viewpoint, Emote-trait specifically
        seems to offset and counteract the negative emotional impact of chronic
        pain. Moreover, given that factors 2–3 predetermined response to placebo
        treatment, and since we have shown (based on this same data [

        ]) that placebo response is predetermined from personality and brain
        anatomy and functional connectivity, we propose that the trajectories of
        personality reorganization with development of chronic pain, that is the
        interplay between factor 1 and factors 2 and 3, in turn determines CBP
        placebo response types.

        Throughout this manuscript, we refer to the PCA factors comprising
        psychological and personality outcome measures as “traits.” Three of
        these factors (2–4) are composed of fundamental personality attributes
        and emotional characteristics observed in the population at large and
        are unlikely to represent risk factors for developing CBP, as no such
        evidence has been described in the past and the concept makes little
        mechanistic sense. The pain-related factor is, however, comprised of
        outcomes specific to chronic pain patients, which would by definition be
        changing over time, as pain transitions from an acute to a chronic
        condition (in this phase perhaps all four factors may be more fluid and
        reorganizing, paralleling brain reorganization). Further, given that
        chronic back pain is a negative affective condition that can last for
        decades or even a lifetime, associated dominant personality factors must
        be considered stable and thus traits but may also be undergoing
        fluctuations in response to new experiences painful and otherwise. We
        propose that the identified factors should be “cardinal” or “central”
        traits of chronic back pain as we expect that they dominate and shape
        these patients’ everyday behaviors [

        Still, the approach raises new and critical questions that require
        further study. First, there is a general consensus that the human
        population at large is composed of five broad personality traits, also
        known as the Five-Factor-Model [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref014
        content:
          - '14'
      - >-
        ]. Our results show that most of these traits are clustered together in
        CBP (Character-trait), while other aspects (Emote-trait) become
        differentially related to chronic pain. Importantly, while subjective
        well-being is observed in individuals scoring high in extraversion and
        low in neuroticism in the population at large [
      - type: Cite
        target: pbio-3000349-ref041
        content:
          - '41'
      - >-
        ], in CBP, these characteristics load on orthogonal factors (that is,
        they vary independently) and relate to distinct properties. How the CBP
        traits (and their interrelationships) change and congeal in the
        transition from acute to chronic pain is unknown and will be exciting to
        explore. It will also be important to study the role of traits and
        individual differences in traits in the context of treatments for
        chronic pain. Such knowledge would be important to know from a
        risk-management viewpoint; concurrently, knowledge regarding
        malleability of these traits could provide targets for psychological or
        cognitive behavioral interventions. Second, we do not know the extent of
        invariance in the identified traits across different clinical chronic
        pain conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, phantom pain,
        complex regional pain syndrome, pelvic pain, etc.), many of which are
        known to differ in their underlying biology (e.g., somatic versus
        visceral conditions). We also do not know how the covariance (network
        architecture) between these traits may change after different kinds of
        treatments or therapies. Further studies exploring these issues are
        certainly warranted.

        independent brain atlases, showed good reliability across four brain

        brain regions not necessarily related to acute or chronic pain. The
        networks did still include a large number of connections that included
        the prefrontal cortex and the DMN, especially Neurotrait 1, consistent
        with earlier evidence showing involvement of these regions in chronic
        pain and catastrophizing [

        Our results support the existence of multiple brain systems contributing
        and modulating the chronic pain experience. These systems involve
        different circuitry representing a different mixture of psychological
        factors and personality traits. This is in accordance with the
        literature indicating that several systems may contribute to chronic
        pain. For instance, several studies have indicated that the DMN linked
        with pain catastrophizing determines pain intensity [

        pain perception and determines risk for transition to chronic pain [

        ]. Accordingly, we demonstrate that psychological components of
        Pain-trait (pain catastrophizing, anxiety, acceptance) determined
        vulnerability or protection (association with all pain measurements) and
        Emote-trait (neuroticism, sensitivity to loss, optimism, and mindfulness
        capacities) determined resilience (association with negative affect and
        physical health). Furthermore, we show that such a concept of resilience
        is complex and can be determined by multiple independent traits and
        neurotraits. Thus, these findings suggest multiple dimensions of
        personality interacting to determine unique chronic pain experiences
        that each have their own biology. Future studies should also incorporate
        neuroanatomical and structural brain properties, as these factors may
        further enhance the explanatory power of the neurotraits in relation to
        corresponding psychological/personality traits of CBP.

        Chronic pain traits and neurotraits were specifically associated with
        income. One may conclude that these are at least partially interlinked
        with environmental factors beyond the SES variables studied here to also
        include upbringing, culture, and politics. Our results replicate
        previous research findings showing that lower incomes related with
        higher pain scores but also increased disability resulting from chronic
        pain [

        ]. Importantly, SES was most strongly linked with subscales defining the
        traits of patients, as income correlated with components of Pain-trait
        (catastrophizing and anxiety of pain) and Emote-trait 4 (optimism).
        Moreover, the association between income with Neurotrait 1, and
        Neurotrait 2 further enhances confidence in the consistency and
        interpretability of the identified brain networks reflecting the traits.
        Thus, the link between income and our traits provides insights into the
        social component of the biopsychosocial model and further substantiates
        the idea that chronic pain experience is not only rooted in biology but
        also intimately embedded in society.

Finally, the social variables were restricted to sex/gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and income, while other variables such as working environment, city living, marital status, and access to healthcare were not included or collected, even though they likely also play a role in the expression of pain traits or neurotraits. Therefore, future studies should include additional variables to fully examine the interplay between the neurobiological, psychological, and social components of chronic pain.'

        We advance a methodology for identifying traits in neuropathic CBP, but
        the dimensions used to develop the trait space are globally relevant to
        other chronic pain conditions. Besides providing a comprehensive
        specification of the biopsychosocial properties of CBP, the approach
        provides tools and metrics that enable direct comparisons between such
        conditions regarding the linkage between neurophysiology and the
        psychology of chronic pain. Future studies are, however, necessary to
        replicate the identified traits and neurotraits, test generalizability
        across chronic pain conditions, and determine their clinical utility.

        Each patient’s pain was monitored electronically using an app designed
        specifically for the study. The app had a VAS scale with sliding bars on
        which the participant was asked to rate their current pain level from 0
        (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable). Participants were instructed to use
        the app twice a day and were compensated $0.25 for each rating they
        submitted, up to $0.50/day. This additional payment was given at the end
        of the study to encourage compliance throughout the study. The ratings
        were sent to a secure server and both date- and time-stamped. The
        overall compliance of the phone ratings was on average 76%.

        Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-sensitive T2*-weighted

        fluctuations and improves the detection sensitivity to signal
        fluctuation. The acquisition parameters were: TR = 555 ms, TE = 22.00

        acceleration factor of 8 (8 X 8 simultaneously acquired slices) with

        isomorphic voxels of 2 X 2 X 2 mm, and signal-to-noise ratio was
        optimized by setting the field of view (FoV) to 208 mm. Phase encoding
        direction was from posterior to anterior. The time of acquisition lasted
        10 min and 24 sec, during which 1,110 volumes were collected. The

        ]. The first 120 volumes of each functional dataset were removed in
        order to allow for magnetic field stabilization. The decision to remove
        this number of volumes was taken arbitrarily (it was not motivated upon
        examination of data) and we explored no other option. This left a total
        of 990 volumes for functional connectivity analyses. The effect of
        intermediate to large motion was initially removed using
        fsl_motion_outliers. Time series of BOLD signal were filtered with a
        Butterworth band-pass filter (0.008 Hz < f < 0.1 Hz) and a nonlinear
        spatial filter (using SUSAN tool from FSL; FWHM = 5 mm). The six
        parameters obtained by rigid body correction of head motion, global
        signal averaged over all voxels of the brain, white matter signal
        averaged over all voxels of eroded white matter region, and ventricular
        signal averaged over all voxels of eroded ventricle region were then
        regressed out from the BOLD signal. These nine vectors were filtered
        with the Butterworth band-pass filter prior to being regressed from the
        time series. Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition
        into Independent Components (MELODIC tool in FSL) was used to identified
        components in the time series that were most likely not representing
        neuronal activity. Components representing motion artifact were
        identified if the ratio between activated edge (one voxel) and all
        activated regions on a spatial component was >0.45, or if the ratio
        between activated white matter and ventricle and whole-brain white
        matter and ventricles was >0.35. Moreover, noisy components were
        identified if the ratio between high frequency (0.05–0.1) and low
        frequency (0.008–0.05) was > 1. This ICA regression procedure was kept
        very conservative to identify only obvious components related to motion
        or noise.

        The functional image registration was optimized according to a two-step
        procedure. All volumes of the functional images were averaged within
        each patient to generate a contrast image representative of the 990
        volumes. A common template specific to our CBP patients was generated by
        linearly registering these mean images to the MNI template and averaging
        these contrast images across all participants. All preprocessed
        functional images were nonlinearly registered to this common template
        using FNIRT tool from FSL. The registered brains were visually inspected
        to ensure optimal registration.

        On average, relative head motion was relatively low (mean frame

        motion was not related with any of the neurotraits (see below).

    Number of components from the PCA and correspondence between the groups.A.
    PCA was performed in Group 1 and Group 2 separately. The components with
    eigenvalues greater than 2.0 (symbols in red) were retained and correlated
    with pain outcomes. Other components with eigenvalues below 2.0 (white
    symbols) were used as components of personality and no exploratory analyses
    were performed with these. B. The PCA performed on the same variables in
    Group 2 CBP identified the same four components (validation). Scatterplots
    show strong correspondences between loading values of each component, across
    the two groups (validation). CBP, chronic back pain; PCA, principal
    component analysis.(TIF)

    Cross-parcellation reproducibility.A–B. The Power atlas used to derive the
    neurotraits as presented in Fig 3. C. The Schaefer atlas was used as a
    second atlas to test the robustness of our results. D. Pain-trait was
    determined from both positive (r2 = 0.08; P = 0.006) and negative (r2 =
    0.04; P = 0.04) links and Emote-trait could be determined by positive (r2 =
    0.06; P = 0.03) but not negative links. E. The interindividual correlations
    between the cross-validated links from the two atlases showed that the
    cross-parcellation yielded robust results. This suggests that the
    neurotraits were not specific to our choice of parcellation scheme and
    provide evidence that they represent a robust metric. Significance was
    determined with a permutation test (10,000 permutation). *P < 0.05, **P
    <0.01, ***P < 0.001.(TIF)

    Other measures of socioeconomic status related with income (displayed when
    pooling Group 1 and Group 2).Income depended on race/ethnicity (A) and
    education (B). HA, AA, WA, HS (≤12 [yoe]), AD (12 yoe > AD < 16 yoe), BD
    (≥16 yoe). All post-hoc comparisons are Bonferroni corrected for three
    comparisons. &P < 0.08, **P < 0.01. AA, African American; AD, Associate
    degree; BD, Bachelor’s degree; HA, Hispanic American, HS, high school; WA,
    White American; yoe, years of education.(TIF)

    Basic demographics for both groups.Group 1 was on average 5 years younger
    than Group 2 (unpaired t test(106); t = 4.67, P = 0.03). There were no
    significant differences between the groups for gender, pain duration, or
    education level.(PDF)

    List of questionnaires administered to patients for profiling psychological
    factors and personality traits.Thirteen self-report measures (36 measures
    total if divided into respective subscales) were completed at designated
    visits in the study. The names and abbreviation are provided for each
    questionnaire, along with the rationale for why each measure was included in
    our battery.(DOCX)

    Baseline values of back pain characteristics in both CBP groups prior to
    treatment.There were no differences in absolute scores of pain measurements
    between the groups, with the exception of physical health (SF-12p), which
    was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. CBP, chronic back pain.(PDF)
