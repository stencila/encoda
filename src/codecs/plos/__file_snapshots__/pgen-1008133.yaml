      - ' wing has been a valuable model system to reveal the existence of a stress response mechanism involved in the coordination of growth between adjacent cell populations and to identify a role of the fly orthologue of p53 (Dmp53) in this process. Here we identify the molecular mechanisms used by Dmp53 to regulate growth and proliferation in a non-autonomous manner. First, Dmp53-mediated transcriptional induction of Eiger, the fly orthologue of TNFα ligand, leads to the cell-autonomous activation of JNK. Second, two distinct signaling events downstream of the Eiger/JNK axis are induced in order to independently regulate tissue size and cell number in adjacent cell populations. Whereas expression of the hormone dILP8 acts systemically to reduce growth rates and tissue size of adjacent cell populations, the production of Reactive Oxygen Species—downstream of Eiger/JNK and as a consequence of apoptosis induction—acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to reduce proliferation rates. Our results unravel how local and systemic signals act concertedly within a tissue to coordinate growth and proliferation, thereby generating well-proportioned organs and functionally integrated adults.'

        Coordinated tissue growth is essential for the generation of
        functionally integrated organs during animal development, as well as for
        tissue homeostasis during adult life. Although a broad range of genes
        and pathways regulating growth has been uncovered, the exact mechanisms
        by which cells within the same tissue maintain tissue homeostasis by
        responding to stress in a coordinated manner are less understood.

        The p53 tumor suppressor regulates the mammalian cell stress response
        through direct transcriptional activation of specific target genes

        ] as a direct effector of Dmp53 mediating intra-organ growth. We
        demonstrate that Egr acts through its receptor Grindelwald (Grnd) and
        Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling to reduce the growth and
        proliferation rates of adjacent cell populations. The inactivation of
        Egr or JNK signaling in slow-growing cell populations disrupts the
        coordination of growth among adjacent tissue domains, resulting in
        unproportioned adult wings. We further demonstrate that the regulation
        of tissue growth and proliferation rates by Dmp53 can be uncoupled and
        independently regulated by two distinct mechanisms downstream of Egr-JNK
        signaling. Whereas dILP8 expression is required to coordinate
        intra-organ growth and final tissue size, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
        production downstream of Egr/JNK and as a consequence of apoptosis
        induction acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to regulate the
        proliferation rates of adjacent epithelial cells. Taken together, our
        results show how local mechanisms along with systemic responses act
        together to coordinate the growth and proliferation of different parts
        of an organ.

        molecules regulated by the Dmp53/Egr/JNK axis and acting during larval
        stages to reduce, in a Dilp8-independent and non-cell autonomous manner,
        proliferation rates. Our results also suggest the presence of
        alternative mechanisms, most probably acting in subsequent developmental
        periods, to adjust final cell number to tissue size.

        cell populations is required for both apoptotic and proliferative
        responses in unperturbed territories. Eiger-dependent JNK activation was
        restricted to slow-growing domains, and inhibition of Grnd-JNK signaling
        in the growth-depleted territory was sufficient to restore normal size
        in adjacent domains. Therefore, although Eiger can act as a soluble
        ligand and activate JNK signaling in distant cells under certain
        circumstances, the role of this protein in coordinating intra-organ
        growth seems to be restricted to the growth-depleted tissue and involves

        primordia activates Dilp8 expression through the transcription factor
        Xrp1, and the Xrp1-Dilp8 axis has been shown to have an impact on the
