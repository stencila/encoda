        The causative mutation responsible for limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1F
        (LGMD1F) is one heterozygous single nucleotide deletion in the stop
        codon of the nuclear import factor Transportin 3 gene 
      - type: Emphasis
        content:
          - (TNPO3
      - >-
        ). This mutation causes a carboxy-terminal extension of 15 amino acids,
        producing a protein of unknown function (TNPO3_mut) that is co-expressed
        with wild-type TNPO3 (TNPO3_wt). TNPO3 has been involved in the nuclear
        transport of serine/arginine-rich proteins such as splicing factors and
        also in HIV-1 infection through interaction with the viral integrase and
        capsid. We analyzed the effect of TNPO3_mut on HIV-1 infection using
        PBMCs from patients with LGMD1F infected ex vivo. HIV-1 infection was
        drastically impaired in these cells and viral integration was reduced
        16-fold. No significant effects on viral reverse transcription and
        episomal 2-LTR circles were observed suggesting that the integration of
        HIV-1 genome was restricted. This is the second genetic defect described
        after CCR5Δ32 that shows strong resistance against HIV-1 infection.

        ]. Viral entry depends on fusion of viral and cellular membranes through
        successive interactions with CD4 receptor combined with CXC chemokine
        receptor type 4 (CXCR4) or CC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) [

        ]. Once the core is released into the cytosol, the reverse transcriptase
        converts the viral RNA genome into a double-stranded copy DNA (cDNA) and
        the capsid (CA) uncoating process is initiated. HIV-1 cDNA gains access
        to the nucleus through the cellular nuclear transport machinery located
        at the nuclear pore, in the form of a pre-integration complex (PIC).
        These PICs consist of viral cDNA and other HIV-1 components like
        integrase (IN), matrix, nucleocapsid, CA and viral protein R (Vpr), as
        well as various host proteins, such as the high mobility group protein
        B1 (HMGB1), barrier to autointegration factor 1 (BAF1),
        lamina-associated polypeptide 2α (LAP2α) and lens-epithelium derived
        growth factor (LEDGF/p75) [

        such as serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), SR-rich splicing

        (IFN)-mediated innate responses, allowing HIV-1 to escape from immune
        sensing and favouring infection. In fact, HIV-1 virions carrying CA

        HIV-1 infection remains incurable despite efficient antiretroviral
        treatments that tackle HIV-1 enzymes and proteins. One potential
        strategy to develop new therapeutic targets can be based on the study of
        the interaction between viral proteins and their cellular cofactors. In
        this regard, TNPO3 and other importins have been previously described as
        essential cellular proteins for HIV-1 infection [

        Of note, nuclear transport has not been widely studied as a potential

        muscular dystrophy termed LGMD1F. The genetic cause for LGMD1F was found
        to be an adenosine deletion in the stop codon of

        is still unknown but previous data indicate that TNPO3_mut shows a
        perinuclear distribution whereas TNPO3_wt predominantly localizes inside
        the nucleus. This suggests that TNPO3 mutation could affect the
        subcellular localization of the protein [

        mutation affects its function and causes LGMD1F remains undetermined.
        Interestingly, other rare muscular diseases known as laminopathies are
        related to changes in the nuclear lamin architecture, a fibrous
        structure located below the nuclear membrane which functions include
        among others the regulation of the nuclear transport [

        ]. Besides, other muscle diseases like myotonic dystrophies are due to
        mutations in splicing factors. For these reasons the term
        “splicepathies” has been proposed to design these genetic diseases [

        ]. In summary, the biomedical interest of TNPO3 is first, as an
        essential cellular protein in the HIV-1 cycle and second through a
        specific mutation, as the genetic cause of the ultra-rare disease
        LGMD1F. In this context, we propose that the understanding of HIV-1
        biology in lymphocytes from LGMD1F patients represents a tool to get a
        better insight into the mechanisms of nuclear transport and to
        understand the pathogenic mechanisms leading to muscle disease such as
        muscular dystrophies that share common physiopathology pathways.

        ], the efficacy of infection is lower with N74D clone as compared to a
        wt virus, which explains lower luciferase levels. Interestingly,
        infection with N74D virus was not equal in the PBMCs of all LGMD1F
        patients as in some of them the infection with the mutant virus was
        higher than in controls, suggesting that PBMCs from some patients with
        LGMD1F can develop compensatory mechanism to overcome the deficiency in
        TNPO3-mediated transport. By unknown reasons, age of onset and severity
        of clinical symptoms are highly variable in LGMD1F patients, despite all
        of them carry the same mutation, pointing to the presence of alternative
        mechanisms that compensate the deficit in TNPO3 function.

        Due to the central role of TNPO3 in HIV-1 nuclear import, we

        resistance to HIV-1 infection ex vivo was observed in these cells, with
        a reduction of more than 18-fold on average in the production of viral
        proteins. These results suggest that in patients with LGMD1F TNPO3_mut
        was interfering with the normal function of TNPO3_wt. It has been
        proposed that TNPO3 multimerizes in order to carry out its nuclear
        import functions [

        multimerization of TNPO3_wt, this could explain the severe restriction
        of viral infection observed in LGMD1F cells despite the co-dominant

        The cytosolic location of CPSF6 in lymphocytes from patients with LGMD1F
        confirms the functional impact of the mutated protein “in vivo” for the

        knockdown causes CPSF6 to accumulate in the cytoplasm [

        To confirm these data we generated HeLaP4 cell lines with stable
        knock-down of endogenous TNPO3 that were trans-complemented with either
        TNPO3_wt or TNPO3_mut form associated to LGMD1F. As described before,
        depletion of endogenous TNPO3 resulted in decreased viral infectivity
        that was recovered with the back-complementation of TNPO3_wt. However,
        expression of the TNPO3_mut form of the protein resulted in lower
        recovery of HIV-1 infection, which supports that the TNPO3_mut form
        found in LGMD1F patients restricts HIV-1 infection.

        patients in comparison with healthy controls. There were no significant
        differences between the cells of patients and controls in the formation
        of early and late reverse transcripts 5 hours after the infection. It

        into the nucleus cannot be concluded. However, integration was decreased
        more than 16-fold in PBMCs from LGMD1F patients in comparison to

        When using fluorescently labeled viruses (HIV-IN-eGFP), no differences

        However at 24 hours post-infection the number of infected cells, as
        defined by IN-eGFP detection, was significantly decreased in patients
        with LGMD1F. Unexpectedly, only cytoplasmic complexes were reduced,
        suggesting a decreased stability of the complexes that was not a
        consequence of higher translocation to the nucleus, as there was no
        increase in the number of nuclear PICs. The change in subcellular
        distribution of CPSF6 could not explain this observation since an
        increase in CA stability due to cytosolic CPSF6 location after silencing

        PIC numbers could be related to the induction of innate immune responses
        leading to CA degradation. It has been described that in macrophages
        HIV-1 evades innate immune recognition in macrophages through specific
        recruitment of cellular factors to the CA, including TNPO3 and CPSF6 to
        the CA [

        function is essential for HIV-1 replication infection, but they also
        provide insights into the role of TNPO3 in LGMD1F. It should be noted
        that although LGMD1F patients show progressive muscle weakness as the
        disease advances, they do not show any type of immunodeficiency or
        higher susceptibility to infectious diseases. Therefore, the presence of

        wide variability in the muscular clinical symptoms that affects these
