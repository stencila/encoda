      - >-
        Severe falciparum malaria is a medical emergency characterised by
        potentially lethal vital organ dysfunction. Patient fatality rates even
        with parenteral artesunate treatment remain high. Despite considerable
        research into adjuvant therapies targeting organ and tissue dysfunction,
        none have shown efficacy apart from renal replacement therapy.
        Understanding the causal contributions of clinical and laboratory
        abnormalities to mortality is essential for the design and evaluation of
        novel therapeutic interventions.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        We used a structural model causal inference approach to investigate
        causal relationships between epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical
        variables in patients with severe falciparum malaria enrolled in
        clinical trials and their in-hospital mortality. Under this causal
        model, we analysed records from 9,040 hospitalised children (0–12
        years,

          - 'n'
      - ' = 3,405, 12–87 years) with severe falciparum malaria from 15 countries in Africa and Asia who were studied prospectively over the past 35 years. On admission, patient covariates associated with increased in-hospital mortality were severity of acidosis (odds ratio [OR] 2.10 for a 7-mEq/L increase in base deficit [95% CI 1.93–2.28]), renal impairment (OR 1.71 for a 2-fold increase in blood urea nitrogen [95% CI 1.58, 1.86]), coma (OR 3.59 [95% CI 3.07–4.21]), seizures (OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.16–1.68]), shock (OR 1.51 [95% CI 1.14–1.99]), and presumed pulmonary oedema (OR 1.58 [95% CI 1.04–2.39]). Lower in-hospital mortality was associated with moderate anaemia (OR 0.87 for a decrease of 10 percentage points in haematocrit [95% CI 0.80–0.95]). Circulating parasite density was not associated with mortality (OR 1.02 for a 6-fold increase [95% CI 0.94–1.11]), so the pathological effects of parasitaemia appear to be mediated entirely by the downstream effects of sequestration. Treatment with an artemisinin derivative decreased mortality compared with quinine (OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.56–0.74]). These estimates were consistent across children and adults (mainly representing African and Asian patients, respectively). Using inverse probability weighting, transfusion was not estimated to be beneficial in children with admission haematocrit values between 15% and 25% (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.97–1.02]). Except for the effects of artemisinin treatment and transfusion, causal interpretations of these estimates could be biased by unmeasured confounding from severe bacterial sepsis, immunity, and duration of illness.'

    content:
      - >-
        These data suggest that moderate anaemia is associated with a reduced
        risk of death in severe falciparum malaria. This is possibly a direct
        causal association. The severe anaemia threshold criteria for a
        definition of severe falciparum malaria should be reconsidered.

        ]. Patient fatality following treatment with parenteral artesunate is
        significantly lower than with quinine but still ranges between 10% and
        30%, depending on the number and severity of complications present on
        admission [

        Assessing the predictive value of admission ‘phenotypes’, as defined by
        clinical and laboratory covariates, on the outcome of severe malaria
        (i.e., risk factors) may improve the recognition of patients who are
        likely to deteriorate and thus help identify those who would benefit
        most from escalation of care [

        ]. This does not require ascribing causality. However, determining
        causal relationships between measurable admission variables and outcome
        does provide a rational basis for optimising treatment and evaluating
        life-saving adjuvant interventions. This is an important consideration,
        as many adjuvant therapies have been evaluated in severe malaria, often
        without a clear rationale. Apart from renal replacement therapy, to date
        none of these have been proved effective, and several were shown to be
        harmful [

        allows for the identification of key confounders and possible selection
        bias [

        In the absence of randomisation, estimating the direction and magnitude

        ]. The past 3 decades have seen considerable advances in the field of
        causal inference, and these have had major implications for epidemiology
        research. Counterfactual reasoning is the dominant framework. This
        attempts to estimate contrasts of potential outcomes between groups who
        did receive and did not receive an exposure of interest [

        ]. Causal diagrams, represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are
        the key algebraic tool. Within the area of causal inference in
        epidemiology, there is debate as to which experimental conditions allow
        for the valid estimation of causal effects [

        In this work, we take a pragmatic approach to the important question,
        ‘Which clinical or pathological features of severe falciparum malaria
        cause death, and by how much?’ We attempt to estimate the causal
        contributions to mortality of key, routinely measured, clinical

        ], underpinned by mechanistic understanding of the causal and temporal
        processes in severe malaria. We constructed template causal diagrams of
        the main causal pathways in severe malaria. These outlined our
        hypotheses concerning the relationships between clinical and laboratory
        covariates measured before starting treatment for severe malaria and
        mortality, and so they were used to determine the set of adjustment
        variables necessary to remove confounding bias. The fundamental
        biological assumption is that the major process leading to death in
        severe falciparum malaria—an acute and life-threatening syndrome—is the
        extensive sequestration of parasitised erythrocytes in the
        microvasculature leading to vital organ dysfunction [

        regression models, with in-hospital death as the predicted outcome,
        using one of the largest prospectively collected pooled datasets of
        patients with severe falciparum malaria, comprising 9,040 children and
        adults from Africa and Southeast Asia.

        implements causal calculus (d-separation rules). Conditional on the
        causal diagram under consideration, this determines the necessary
        adjustment sets to allow for unbiased estimation of the total or direct
        causal effects on the outcome variable. We make the distinction between
        direct effects and total effects. The direct effect is the effect of the
        exposure (e.g., anaemia) on death at a fixed level of the mediator
        (e.g., for a fixed degree of acidosis). This is termed a controlled
        direct effect in the causal inference literature. The total effect
        includes indirect effects via mediating variables (e.g., acidosis).

        falciparum malaria are a function of the sequestered pathogen (parasite)
        load, which is the key process leading to vital organ dysfunction and
        potentially resulting in a fatal outcome. Therefore, in the DAG model
        describing the sequential pathogenic mechanisms that result in severe
        falciparum malaria, observed parasite biomass (circulating parasite
        densities measured in a peripheral blood smear) plays a central role, as
        this may be considered a proxy for the more important unobserved
        parasite biomass (sequestered parasites). Although we believe this DAG
        represents important relationships between clinical and laboratory
        covariates measured in patients with severe malaria, the pathogenic
        mechanisms that govern interindividual variation in disease severity and
        organ failure at the time of hospital admission in nonimmune hosts with
        severe falciparum malaria remain poorly understood.

        The important unmeasured variables are ‘Sepsis’ and ‘Lactate’ (missing

        proportion of unmeasured bacterial sepsis caused by the malarial
        infection would result in confounding for all exposure–outcome
        relationships. Bacteraemia, particularly with enteropathogens, is common
        in children diagnosed with severe malaria, but it is uncommon in adults.
        Although severe malaria does predispose to sepsis, many cases in
        children in endemic areas diagnosed as severe malaria are likely to
        represent primary septicaemia with incidental malaria [

        Any resulting association between these factors and mortality may then
        be interpreted as causal. This causal interpretation relies on three key
        assumptions, known as conditional exchangeability (no unmeasured
        confounding), consistency, and positivity. Consistency means that the
        probability of the outcome is the same whether the value of a variable
        was simply observed or was intervened upon. For example, in this
        context, consistency implies that the probabilities of death in a
        patient with 35% haematocrit on admission and in an identical patient
        but with 10% haematocrit on admission who received a blood transfusion
        leading to 35% haematocrit are equal (in the highly idealised scenario
        in which blood transfusions happen instantaneously). Positivity means
        that every value of the exposure variable (e.g., haematocrit) has a
        nonzero probability of occurring in all patient strata.

        In the statistical analyses, we adjusted for antimalarial treatment

        proxies study site and country) which explains large differences between

We focus this methodological reflection on haematocrit (anaemia), with analogous arguments for renal failure, acidosis, coma, seizures, and pulmonary oedema. In a population of interest, steady-state haemoglobin concentrations can be thought of as randomly assigned, corresponding to differences in host genetics (e.g., haemoglobinopathies), sex, age, and environmental influences (diet, recent haemolytic events such as malaria, the bone marrow dysfunction associated with malaria, intestinal helminth coinfections, geographical location, and access to healthcare). When considering admission haematocrits in the context of severe-malaria clinical trials, additional factors are important: host immunity, host splenic function, host–parasite interactions, and parasite genetics (all potentially affecting parasite multiplication rates and pathogen load). Note that some of these do confound the relationship with survival and should therefore be adjusted for. However, the non-confounding factors (some host genetics, age, sex, diet, recent haemolysis, bone marrow dysfunction, coinfection) are likely to determine the majority of the variation in haematocrits observed at presentation. These factors are complex, but there is no reason to believe that their overall effect—changing the admission haematocrit—should not be approximately equivalent to the intervention of blood transfusion (or the hypothetical reverse intervention of removing blood). Therefore, we argue that the contribution of anaemia on mortality corresponds to a well-defined (from an interventionist perspective) causal question.'

        In the pooled dataset, several variables were missing in a significant
        proportion of records. Coma status was missing from 229 records (3%),
        haematocrit from 870 (10%), parasite density from 1,882 (21%), base
        deficit from 2,375 (26%), plasma bicarbonate from 3,679 (41%),
        respiratory rate from 369 (4%), venous blood or plasma lactate from
        7,423 (82%), blood urea nitrogen from 1,544 (17%), plasma creatinine
        from 7,242 (80%), transfusion information from 2,342 (22%), and
        information on hypoglycaemia from 115 records (1%).

        Imputation of missing variables was done using known mechanistic
        relationships with other recorded variables and was done sequentially,
        processing from the most-informative recorded variable to the least
        informative.

                We used the auxiliary variables bicarbonate, lactate, and
                respiratory rate to impute missing base deficit values. For base
                deficit, this was done with Gaussian error linear models, first
                using bicarbonate, and then, if that value was also missing, we
                used lactate and then finally respiratory rate for the remaining
                missing values. Remaining missing values were then modelled from
                the marginal age-adjusted distributions.

                We used plasma creatinine to impute missing blood urea nitrogen
                values. Imputation for missing blood urea nitrogen values was
                also done with a Gaussian linear model on the log scale, with
                creatinine used as the predictive variable. Remaining missing
                values were imputed from the marginal distribution.

We believe that data from Asian adults will not be significantly confounded by the presence of sepsis, as this has been investigated prospectively, and the estimated prevalence in adult severe falciparum malaria at presentation is less than 2%. This is based on observations from the AQ and AAV studies done in Vietnam, whereby admission blood cultures were performed systematically. In the AQ study, eight patients had positive blood cultures out of 560 (1.4%), and in the AAV study, six out of 220 were positive, but two of these were coagulase-negative staphylococci, which were likely contaminants, giving a global estimate of 1.8% (the remaining 150 records in the AAV study could not be matched).'

Therefore, a sensitivity analysis only using patient records with full data (for the variables of interest) should not introduce any major biases but will have reduced power.'

        In order to obtain marginal causal estimates for the effect of
        transfusion on death in children with admission haematocrits within a
        ‘moderate anaemia range’ of 15%–25%, we used inverse probability
        weighting (IPW) with propensity scores. The range of 15%–25% haematocrit
        was chosen, as it is above the AQUAMAT trial threshold for transfusion
        (15% haematocrit). Below 25% haematocrit, the estimated weights were all
        less than 10. The sample size was not large enough for an equivalent
        analysis in adults, as only the AQ and AAV studies reliably recorded
        transfusion status.

        the numerator of each weight was the marginal probability of the

        denominator was the individual probability of the intervention
        (transfused or not transfused) estimated using a fixed-effects logistic
        regression model with the following independent predictors: the site
        country, admission haematocrit, presence of convulsions, base deficit

        The primary goal of this study was to estimate unbiased causal effects
        on the subsequent in-hospital mortality from severe falciparum malaria
        of the absolute admission values of haematocrit (anaemia), base deficit
        (acidosis), blood urea nitrogen (AKI), and circulating parasitaemia
        (percent of parasitised red blood cells) and the presence of coma,
        seizures, shock, and pulmonary oedema measured or observed on enrolment
        in these prospective studies. Antimalarial treatments have a major
        impact on outcome, and adequately powered randomised drug trials (with
        balanced randomisation) should remove any confounding effects and thus
        allow for direct causal interpretation of observed differences between
        groups. However, for baseline characteristics such as anaemia,
        randomisation is not possible. Mendelian randomisation (for example,
        using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency, a causal
        genetic variant for lower haemoglobin concentrations in acute infections

        minor contributor to mortality from severe falciparum malaria. Severe
        malaria does predispose to concomitant bacteraemia, usually with

        Under our causal model assumptions, ‘moderate anaemia’ was protective

        percentage points corresponded to a mortality odds ratio of 0.87 (95% CI
        0.80–0.95). This assumes a linear relationship between haematocrit and
        the log-odds of death, which must be incorrect for extremely low
        haematocrit values. A sensitivity analysis removing patients with
        admission haematocrits less than or equal to 9% (a haemoglobin of

        Blood transfusion could mediate the relationship between anaemia and
        death. The apparent protective effect of lower haematocrits in severe
        malaria could result from the beneficial effect provided by blood
        transfusions given to patients presenting with haematocrits below a
        certain threshold (this varied by study and site but typically ranged
        from 15% to 20%). However, a naive mediation analysis via a simple
        adjustment for transfusion status results in selection (‘collider’) bias

        rapidly after admission, because of the time required to cross-match
        blood and then set up a transfusion. This selection bias can be reduced
        by stratifying by time to death. This information was recorded in all
        patients. We assume that patients surviving longer than 4 hours
        postadmission (randomisation) have probabilities of receiving
        transfusions conditionally independent of their time to death,
        conditional on study site and baseline covariates. The value of 4 hours

            (A) One explanation for the apparent protective effect of moderate
            anaemia on fatal outcomes in severe falciparum malaria might be that
            blood transfusions given to anaemic patients are independently
            beneficial. The probability of receiving a blood transfusion is
            affected by the presence and severity of anaemia at baseline and
            also depends on blood availability and local treatment guidelines
            and practices. This DAG shows the proposed causal relationships

        ]. This implies that the unmeasured confounder would need to increase
        the risk of anaemia (as measured by a decrease of 10 absolute percentage
        points in haematocrit) and of mortality by approximately 1.53-fold for
        unmeasured confounding to explain the observed protective relationship
        of haematocrit on mortality. It is difficult to put this number into
        context given the lack of cohort studies sufficiently powered to
        identify individual predictors of mortality at the community healthcare
        level. For example, haemoglobin S has an extremely strong protective
        effect against mortality from severe malaria (and in haemoglobin SS
        homozygotes is associated with reduced steady-state haemoglobin
        concentrations), but this has resulted in very few heterozygous and
        homozygous patients having been enrolled in severe malaria studies.

        In the absence of randomisation, causal inference is difficult and
        relies on nonstatistical assumptions supported by expert knowledge.
        Formalising these assumptions using causal diagrams (DAGs), which are
        readily understood and therefore readily challenged, improves
        transparency and facilitates investigation. Using a structural causal
        models framework [

        ], direct or total causal effects of the main features of severe malaria
        (anaemia, coma, acidosis, seizures, pulmonary oedema, AKI) on death in
        patients with severe falciparum malaria were examined, based on a pooled
        analysis of patient data from 9,040 prospectively studied children and
        adults in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This allowed for causal
        interpretation of factors that have been reported previously to be
        associated with increased risk, but it also suggested that moderate
        anaemia might confer some survival advantage in patients with severe
        falciparum malaria.

        If it is indeed true that ‘moderate anaemia’ (e.g., haematocrits below
        the median values: 23% in the pooled dataset, 20% in African patients,
        and 30% in Asian patients) reduces the mortality of patients with severe
        falciparum malaria, the mechanisms of the protective effect are unclear.
        In severe malaria, macrocirculatory changes are characterised by an
        increase in cardiac output and a moderate decrease in peripheral
        vascular resistance so that severe hypotension is rare [

        ]. However, microcirculatory flow is severely compromised, with an
        increase in microcirculatory resistance caused by sequestered
        parasitised red cells, generally increased erythrocyte rigidity, and
        clumping of unparasitised and parasitised erythrocytes (rosetting and
        autoagglutination, respectively) [

        ]—the pathological process leading to sequestration—and potentially
        decreases rosette formation (intererythrocytic adhesion). Anaemia also
        reduces blood viscosity, in particular under the low-shear conditions at
        the venular side of the circulation, where sequestration begins [

        ]. Thus, moderate anaemia could improve blood flow in the partially
        obstructed microvasculature. The optimal haematocrit, a trade-off
        between oxygen carriage and blood viscosity, might be lower in patients
        with severe falciparum malaria, and this could, in part, contribute to
        the observed unadjusted parabolic relationship between mortality and
        haematocrit (reference [

        , top middle). Planned studies that measure the capillary haematocrit
        directly and also determine oxygen delivery in relation to the level of
        anaemia in severe malaria will be important to support or refute these
        hypotheses.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:

        If moderate anaemia does confer protection against death, it would have
        significant implications for patient management and, particularly, for
        blood transfusion, suggesting a more conservative transfusion strategy
        may be warranted. It should be noted that, whereas transfused red cells
        may have less immediate oxygen-carrying capacity (depending on their
        oxygen dissociation curves), they may be more deformable than the
        relatively rigid erythrocytes that occur in severe malaria. The
        transfused plasma may also have antimalarial activity in endemic areas.
        Thus, the effects of blood transfusion on microvascular perfusion may
        not be predicted accurately by the relationship between haematocrit and
        oxygen delivery in severe falciparum malaria. The mediation analysis in
        this study lacked power to determine whether the protective effect of
        lower haematocrits was partially mediated by blood transfusion or not.
        However, in the reduced pooled data with reliably collected transfusion
        data and stratified by time to death, there was not strong evidence that
        blood transfusion was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. This
        stratification is necessary, as patients who receive transfusions are a
        selected group who by definition have survived long enough to receive
        the blood. Moribund patients may be less likely to be transfused.
        Resolution of this important management question requires prospective
        studies assessing blood transfusion thresholds.

        Our data do not contain information on host genetic markers, but the

        ]. Treatment-seeking behaviour is a very important determinant of
        outcome in a rapidly fatal infection, but adjustment for this effect is
        extremely difficult, as all detailed severe-malaria studies are hospital
        or clinic based. Further confirmation or refutation of this anaemia
        hypothesis must be derived from different data sources. For example, an
        ongoing trial randomising both transfusion and transfusion doses will
        provide high-quality data addressing this exact question [

        This study estimated causal effects from observational data
        (observational with respect to the exposures of interest). The causal
        interpretation of the relationship between patient covariates and
        mortality is strongly dependent on the structure of the underlying
        causal model. The main limitations can be summarised as follows.
        Unmeasured confounding is plausible, leading to indirect relationships
        (e.g., moderate anaemia could in fact be a proxy for another true
        protective variable such as ‘immunity’ or protective genetic
        haplotypes). A key consideration in the DAG is the role of sepsis in the
        causal pathway of severe malaria. In the large majority of the pooled
        data analysed, concomitant sepsis was not assessed by blood culture
        (which itself is an insensitive measure). This could result in
        contamination of the data. Sepsis can occur independently of the
        malarial infection in a patient with incidental asymptomatic
        parasitaemia, or it can be a result of parasite sequestration
        (particularly in the gut). This is mainly an issue in the
        higher-transmission settings in sub-Saharan Africa [
      - type: Cite
        target: pmed-1002858-ref052
        content:
          - '52'
      - >-
        ]. If sepsis (caused by the malarial infection) is included in the DAG
        in 
      - type: Link
        relation: fig

        content:
          - Fig 3
      - >-
        , then none of the causal effects are identifiable. However, in
        sub-Saharan African settings, the effect is likely to be small, given
        that a sensitivity analysis including only data from Asia (40% of the
        available data) gave very similar results to the overall dataset.
        Another limitation in the analysis of this dataset is the nonspecific
        diagnosis of pulmonary oedema in the large AQUAMAT study. Without chest
        radiographs, pulmonary oedema is difficult to diagnose correctly in
        children; however, pulmonary oedema is more a problem of adults
        (particularly pregnant women) than of children. Whereas the specificity
        of the diagnosis of coma, seizures, shock, and laboratory measures
        indicating AKI and hypoglycaemia is very high, the specificity of the
        clinical diagnosis of pulmonary oedema from respiratory distress and
        abnormal chest auscultation is lower.

        Further clinical investigation is necessary to determine whether there
        is truly any benefit from moderate anaemia in patients with severe
        malaria and, if so, to characterise the relationship and its time
        course, as current therapeutic strategies assume only that it is
        harmful. It should be emphasised that this observation refers only to
        patients who present with severe malaria and not to patients with
        uncomplicated malaria. However, it is possible that the apparent
        life-saving benefit provided by moderate anaemia has occurred earlier in
        the course of the illness (i.e., before presentation, preventing the
        development of vital organ dysfunction). A better understanding of the
        pathological process would inform indications for blood transfusion and
        hopefully avoid any detrimental effects of overtransfusion in patients
        with severe falciparum malaria [

        content:

      - >-
        ]. Clearly, this is of critical importance, as severe anaemia is the
        major manifestation of severe malaria in high-transmission settings and
        the main indication for blood transfusion in children in many
        malaria-endemic areas.

        In conclusion, using a causal inference approach to explore the
        relationships between clinical features and mortality in patients with
        severe falciparum malaria, it was found that although six
        well-established measures of vital organ dysfunction were causally
        associated with an increased risk of death, the direction of the causal
        effect of anaemia goes against accepted understanding. Moderate anaemia
        had a relatively small direct protective effect on outcome. Further
        clinical investigation is required. However, this observation, derived
        from a very large prospectively studied population across Asia and
        Africa, does suggest that the current ‘severe anaemia’ criterion for
        severe malaria, which is a 5 g/dL threshold for children and 7 g/dL for
        adults, should be reviewed. The application of causal inference-based
        methodology may be useful in future studies to investigate the direct
        effects of major complications of severe malaria on mortality. This
        could help increase the clinical definition of severe malaria, improve
        the understanding of its pathophysiology, and provide a sound basis for
        developing and evaluating adjunctive interventions.
