# `png`


## Notes

- This has been implemented here to make use of the HTML converter to
  render the results. It currently using Puppetter and so will not work
  in the browser. In the future we may use `html2canvas` and `canvas2image` to enable
  PNGs to be [generated in the browser](https://medium.com/@danielsternlicht/capturing-dom-elements-screenshots-server-side-vs-client-side-approaches-6901c706c56f).
