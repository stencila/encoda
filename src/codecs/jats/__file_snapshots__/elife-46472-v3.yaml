        We identified a locus on mouse chromosome 10 that accounts for 60% of
        the genetic variance in methamphetamine intake in mice selectively bred
        for high versus low methamphetamine consumption. We nominated the trace
        amine-associated receptor 1 gene,

        Amphetamine-like stimulants, including methamphetamine (MA), remain the
        second most common class of illicit drugs used worldwide, behind
        cannabis-containing drugs (

        target: bib67
        content:
          - 'United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2016'
      - ). MA is the most widely abused psychostimulant (

          - 'Chomchai and Chomchai, 2015'

        ), and the consequences of MA addiction pose major societal and health
        concerns (

        ). MA-associated deaths in the United States were relatively stable
        between 2005 and 2013, but have since been on an increasing trajectory,
        rising from about 3600 individuals in 2013 to almost 11,000 in 2017 (

        ). Discovering and understanding genetic factors that contribute to MA
        addiction risk, and uncovering the linked molecular and cellular
        processes, may help to curb this trend and improve interventions and
        long-term treatment success.

        Whereas use of large human cohorts is effective at mapping loci and
        nominating candidate genes, precise experimental control over genetic
        composition, development, and drug exposure history is practical only in
        animal models. Evidence that mouse models continue to contribute
        critical information to our understanding of pathological conditions was
        recently reviewed (

        ). Selected lines of rodents have been derived to model genetic risk
        factors for drug use. These include, particularly, those bred for
        various drug intake phenotypes, such as our mice bred for different
        amounts of voluntary MA intake (

In previous studies, we demonstrated a strong genetic contribution to level of voluntary MA consumption using multiple replicate sets of mice that we bidirectionally, selectively bred for MA high drinking (MAHDR) and MA low drinking (MALDR), which for simplicity are also referred to here as the ‘high’ and ‘low’ lines.

        Our previous findings in the MA drinking lines demonstrated that the
        thermal response to MA is genetically-correlated with level of MA
        consumption. Thus, high line mice are resistant to the hypothermic
        effect of MA, whereas low line mice are highly sensitive to this effect
        of MA (

        identified a significant QTL on chromosome 10 for the effect of MA on
        body temperature. This QTL is in the SNP-poor region of chromosome 10 (

        We observed some differences in body temperature between the knock-in
        and control mice that were unrelated to MA treatment. However, these
        baseline differences did not appear to account for the
        genotype-dependent MA response. Although the knock-in mice had higher
        baseline temperatures and therefore, a greater opportunity to experience
        a reduction in body temperature when treated with MA, the difference at
        baseline was of about 0.5°C, whereas the difference at 30 min post MA
        treatment was over 1°C. This was, in part, because the MA responses were
        qualitatively opposite, with the knock-in mice exhibiting decreases in
        body temperature, similar to MALDR mice, and the controls exhibiting a
        time-dependent increase, similar to MAHDR mice (

        differences in MA consumption in the present studies. Similarly, there
        were some sex effects in the body temperature studies, but sex did not
        determine the pattern of response to saline vs. MA in each genotype

        ). The success of TAAR1 agonists in treatment is dependent upon at least
        partial receptor function that can be enhanced. Whether human TAAR1
        variants are relevant to MA use and addiction in humans, and whether
        TAAR1 agonists are a viable treatment option, are important research
        questions to pursue. Further, research into potential interactive

Starting on the third day, one water tube was replaced with a tube containing MA dissolved in tap water to which mice had access for 18h/day, beginning 3h before the lights turned off. The MA tube was removed for the remaining 6h of each day. Unpublished data (Phillips) indicate that the 6h forced abstinence periods between periods of 18h MA access are important for higher MA intake levels, compared to 24h MA access periods. The MA concentration was 20 mg/l for 4 days, and was increased to 40 mg/l for an additional 4 days. The MA and water tube positions were alternated every other day to account for potential side bias. MA consumption was indexed as the average intake on the second and fourth days of access to each MA concentration, as these days represent the day after the tube positions were switched, when mice should be familiar with the relative locations of the water and MA tubes. MA consumption was measured in ml (accuracy\_=\_0.2 ml), and then converted to mg/kg, based on body weight measured every two days. Total volume consumed (ml) from the water and MA tubes during the 18h MA access periods was also measured."
