    " indicates that taste responses can be modified through experience-dependent changes in mushroom body circuits. In this study, we develop a novel taste learning paradigm using closed-loop optogenetics. We find that appetitive and aversive taste memories can be formed by pairing gustatory stimuli with optogenetic activation of sensory or dopaminergic neurons associated with reward or punishment. As with olfactory memories, distinct dopaminergic subpopulations drive the parallel formation of short- and long-term appetitive memories. Long-term memories are protein synthesis-dependent and have energetic requirements that are satisfied by a variety of caloric food sources or by direct stimulation of MB-MP1 dopaminergic neurons. Our paradigm affords new opportunities to probe plasticity mechanisms within the taste system and understand the extent to which taste responses depend on experience."

        ", the full extent to which taste behaviours are modifiable by learning is unknown. Can taste responses be enhanced by appetitive conditioning? Can flies form long-term memories about taste? These are difficult questions to answer using traditional methods for several reasons. First, appetitive association paradigms generally rely on food as the US, which could interfere with the representation of a taste CS and also modify future taste behaviours through changes in satiety state. Second, repeated temporal pairing of a taste CS with a US is difficult to achieve in flies without immobilization, making long-lasting memories difficult to test. To circumvent these issues, we developed an optogenetic learning paradigm that facilitates rapid, repeated CS/US pairing while maintaining similar satiation states between groups. In this paradigm, we couple a taste (the CS) with optogenetic GRN or dopaminergic neuron stimulation (the US) in order to study conditioned taste responses or ‘taste memories’. For the purpose of our study, we will define a taste memory as a measurable change in a fly’s behavioural response to a previously encountered taste stimulus."

Yet, little is known about how experience influences higher-order taste representations and contributes to the continuous refinement of food selection. In fact, a memory system for the recollection of appetitive taste memories has not been described in flies. In this study, we use the STROBE to establish a novel learning paradigm and further investigate the formation and expression of taste memories. We demonstrate that flies are capable of forming short- and long-term appetitive and aversive taste memories towards two key nutrients – salt, and sugar. Much like olfactory memory, associative taste memory formation occurs within the MB and follows many of the same circuit and energetic principles."

One possible explanation is that because bitter GRN activation strongly inhibits feeding, the number of pairings between sugar taste and bitter activation was insufficient to induce LTM. Consistent with this idea, PPL1 activation, which induced LTM, is less aversive during training and therefore allows more associations."

The red LED was triggered only when a fly interacted with the tastant in channel 1. The duration of the training period was 40 minutes. For the STM training protocol, flies were then transferred to clean empty vials for 10 minutes while the experimental apparatus was cleaned. The training and testing phases of LTM experiments were performed as described for the STM experiments with the following exception: after the 40-minute training period flies, were transferred individually into vials containing standard cornmeal diet or nutrient of interest (sucrose: Sigma #S7903, L-glucose: Sigma #G5500, lactic acid: Sigma #69785, yeast extract: Sigma #Y1625, L-alanine: Sigma #05129, L-aspartic acid: Sigma #11230) and allowed to feed for 1 hour. They were then transferred into 1% agar starvation vials and kept at 18°C until the testing component of the experiment. For MB-MB1 activation experiments, after training flies were placed at 29°C, 70% relative humidity for 1 hour on 1% agar starvation vials. They were then transferred to 18°C and refed 8 hours later, outside of the memory consolidation. After 1 hour of feeding they were once again transferred into 1% agar starvation vials and kept at 18°C until the retrieval component of the experiment.

Data was excluded on the basis of STROBE technical malfunctions for individual flies and criteria for data exclusion are as follows: i) if the light system was not working during training for individual arenas ii) if during training or testing a fly did not meet a standard minimum # of interactions for that genotype iii) if during training or testing the STROBE recorded an abnormally large # of interactions for that genotype iiii) technical malfunctions due to high channel capacitance baseline activity v) if a fly was dead in an arena."
