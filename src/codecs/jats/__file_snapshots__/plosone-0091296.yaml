        Reef fishes that exhibit predictable aggregating behaviour are often
        considered vulnerable to overexploitation. However, fisher knowledge of
        this behaviour is often heterogeneous and, coupled with socioeconomic
        factors that constrain demand for or access to aggregated fish, will
        influence susceptibility to fishing. At two case study locations in
        Papua New Guinea, Ahus and Karkar islands, we conducted interview-based
        surveys to examine how local context influenced heterogeneity in
        knowledge of fish aggregations. We then explored the role of fisher
        knowledge in conferring susceptibility to fishing relative to
        socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort. Local heterogeneity in
        knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed between our case studies. At
        Ahus, variable access rights among fishers and genders to the main
        habitats were sources of heterogeneity in knowledge. By contrast,
        knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the sole source of variation
        was gear type. Differences between locations in the susceptibility of
        aggregations to fishing depended primarily on socioeconomic drivers of
        fishing effort rather than catchability. While Ahus fishers were
        knowledgeable of fish aggregations and used more selective gears, Karkar
        fishers were less constrained by tenure in their access to aggregation
        habitat. However, fishing effort was greater at Ahus and likely related
        to high dependency on fishing, greater access to provincial capital
        markets than Karkar and a weakening of customary management. Moreover,
        highly efficient fishing techniques have emerged at Ahus to exploit the
        non-reproductive aggregating behaviour of target species. Understanding
        how knowledge is structured within fishing communities and its relation
        to socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort is important if customary
        practices for conservation, such as

        The depletion of reef fish biomass is often attributed to overfishing

        and distance from reefs to markets

        . As changes to these key socioeconomic drivers increase demand for
        resources, reef fishes with slow life histories, such as groupers
        (Serranidae), are typically the first to be depleted

        . However, the rate of depletion will also be influenced by the ability
        of fishers to locate and exploit fish populations when they are most
        vulnerable to fishing. Vulnerability to fishing increases when fish
        aggregate or school and the history of fishing is marked by developments

        Interviews were conducted with fishers at Ahus (n = 16) and Karkar
        (Muluk: n = 7; Wadau: n = 9) in October 2012 to quantify fisher
        knowledge on aggregating behaviour and to develop an index of knowledge
        pertaining to fisher perceptions of aggregation predictability. At
        Karkar, interviews were conducted with all fishers for whom fishing was
        a regular livelihood activity. In Ahus, where the proportion of
        residents engaged in fishing was high by comparison, a sample of
        fishers, representative of fisher gender, clan membership and gear use,
        was taken. After pilot studies (n = 4) with Karkar fishers, a

        knowledge of the form, function and predictability of aggregating
        behaviour for six species of reef fish common to fisheries in both

        Firstly, species recognition by fishers was established using a
        combination of pictures (landed specimens) and local names specific to
        location. Secondly, we asked fishers whether they caught each species
        frequently, infrequently or not at all and, if they encountered the
        species, to estimate the ‘poor’, ‘normal’ and ‘good’ catch rates
        (fish.trip
      - type: Superscript
        content:
          - −1
      - >-
        ) that they typically obtain for each species when using their primary
        gear. Thirdly, fishers were questioned on their knowledge of aggregating
        behaviour, initially focusing on whether they observe a species to
        display solitary, shoaling (groups of three or more fish displaying
        unsynchronised swimming) and schooling (groups of three or more fish
        displaying synchronised swimming) behaviour

        . Fishers could assign multiple behavioural types to each species,
        giving eight potential categories including a ‘don't know’ response. For
        example, a species could be identified as solitary and shoaling, or as
        displaying all three behaviour types. Unless specified, ‘aggregation’
        refers to all forms (i.e. shoaling, schooling) and functions (e.g.
        resting) of social group behaviour.

        Seven attributes of the spatial, temporal and physical manifestations of
        aggregating behaviour were employed to quantify fisher knowledge of
        aggregations and their perceived predictability (
      - type: Link
        relation: table
        target: '#pone-0091296-t002'
        content:
          - Table 2
      - >-
        ). Aggregation attributes were discussed for each species and scored
        according to fisher responses. For some statistical tests and analyses (
      - type: Emphasis
        content:
          - see below
      - >-
        ), an index of fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour was calculated
        for each fisher and species by summing the scores for the seven
        aggregation attributes (maximum score = 17; 
      - type: Link
        relation: table
        target: '#pone-0091296-t002'
        content:
          - Table 2
      - >-
        ). Thus, the fisher knowledge index essentially aims to measure the
        predictability of aggregations as perceived by fishers. For example, to
        obtain a maximum score, a fisher would need to recognise that
        aggregations form consistently at specific locations within a small home
        range, that formation aligns with diel, lunar and seasonal schedules,
        that aggregations are large (>500 fish), and that they form for spawning
        (
      - type: Link
        relation: table

        content:
          - Table 2
      - >-
        ). Aggregation size and spawning (presence of eggs or milt) are physical
        manifestations of behaviour that were assumed to promote recall and
        therefore perceived predictability. Since some species were reported as
        constantly shoaling or schooling, questions on periodicities of
        aggregation formation were obviously irrelevant. Therefore, fishers were
        asked as to whether aggregation size in frequently shoaling or schooling
        species (e.g. 
      - type: Emphasis
        content:
          - L. gibbus
      - ) increased with spawning.

        literature pertaining to sources of variation in knowledge among coral
        reef fishers and included gender, dependency on fishing as a livelihood,
        and access rights to major reef habitats and gear types (

        catch the species frequently, infrequently or not at all were used as a
        measure of encounterability, assuming that the gears used by that fisher
        would be as efficient in catching the fish while aggregated. Thirdly, to
        measure selectivity, i.e. the potential of the gear to capture and
        retain species, we used fisher reports of catch rates (fish.trip

        For statistical tests of variation in both individual aggregation
        attributes and in the fisher knowledge index, comparisons were
        restricted to those fishers knowledgeable on the species and its

        each case study as the two locations differ significantly in their
        socioeconomic conditions and the aim was to examine local sources of
        variation in fisher knowledge. Here, all fisher respondents for a
        location were included in the analysis (n = 16) since variation in
        knowledge was integral to the analysis. However, results for Ahus should
        be treated with caution since sample size relative to the number of
        indicator (factor) levels imposed limitations on the RDA. Access to
        habitat was not included in the RDA for Karkar since it did not vary

        Estimates of productivity attributes were averaged to give a single
        productivity score per species. To assess the relative importance of
        catchability and socioeconomic drivers of fishing pressure for the six
        species, each susceptibility attribute was first scored for each fisher
        respondent individually and then averaged across fishers to give a
        single attribute score for each location. Within location, the
        susceptibility attributes were combined by averaging across two sets of
        attributes; (1) the full set of 10 susceptibility attributes, and (2)
        the four catchability attributes (

        populations (six species per location), one for productivity and the
        full set of susceptibility attributes, and a second for productivity and
        using only the four catchability attributes (we only present the PSA
        plot for the full set of susceptibility attributes). From both of these
        PSA plots, overall vulnerability (or risk) was derived for each

        ). The score for fishing effort was higher at Ahus since fishers at that
        location averaged 93 hours of fishing each month compared to 58 hours at
        Karkar. Dependency on fishing was also higher, with more than 80% of
        fishers reporting fishing as their primary livelihood compared to 12.5%
        at Karkar. The majority of fishers at Ahus also reported that they use
        scare lines for catching snappers, ensuring that habitat impacts were
        also comparatively high at that location. Moreover, fishers from Ahus
        regularly accessed markets of neighbouring villages (neighbouring
        islands and the northern coast of Manus) and the provincial capital,
        whereas fishers from Karkar generally traded locally or occasionally in
        neighbouring villages on Karkar. Ownership rights and customary reef
        closure measures still existed at Karkar, but at Ahus fishers reported
        during interviews that the customary closure was no longer being
        respected or complied with. Consequently, including attributes relating
        to socioeconomic drivers resulted in a greater susceptibility of
        aggregations to fishing at Ahus compared to Karkar.

        , we found that fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour varied between
        our two case study communities. While this finding is unsurprising in a
        country of such high cultural and socioeconomic diversity, our study
        makes a contribution by also highlighting the influence of local context
        in structuring knowledge within communities. Thus, the relatively high
        heterogeneity in knowledge at Ahus related to rights of access among
        fishers and genders to the main habitats of the relatively large reef
        system. By contrast, knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the
        sole source of variation was primary gear type. Though knowledge of
        aggregation location and timing are prerequisites for exploitation,
        factors that drive fishing effort will ultimately determine their
        susceptibility to fishing since knowledge, by itself, does not ensure
        that fishers will seek to maximize their extraction from the fishery

        Fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour was particularly heterogeneous
        at Ahus. Since variation at Ahus related to gender and access to reef
        habitats, it appears to stem from the decentralised tenure system that
        specifies ownership rights to space, species, gear and the techniques
        for using gears among kinship groups

        . With less specialisation in specific gears or habitats, knowledge was
        less structured at Karkar compared to Ahus, as indicated by the
        relatively low amount of variation explained by the redundancy analysis.
        Heterogeneity in knowledge was unrelated to dependency on fishing, which
        at Ahus resulted from the fact that fishing was the primary livelihood
        for 80% of fishers, encompassing both genders and fishers with differing
        right of access. Though our objective was to explore local sources of
        variation in knowledge, dependency on fishing may explain why fishing
        effort was higher and fishers used more efficient gears (i.e. scare
        lines) at Ahus.

        Variation in fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed among
        the three families of reef fish. Compared to emperors and groupers,
        knowledge of aggregations of the two snappers was greater and relatively
        homogenous. Snapper aggregation locations were perceived by fishers as
        spatially predictable and were associated with particular features of
        the reef, corresponding with empirical evidence for these species

        Our study was a first step in quantitatively exploring the factors that
        influence local ecological knowledge of reef fish aggregating behaviour
        within communities, but was limited to a small number of socioeconomic
        indicators that reflect the contemporary context of the two communities.
        Consequently, we did not quantify important historical aspects of these
        communities and the role of oral histories in transferring knowledge,
        which may have influenced the patterns observed in our data. For
        example, though we pooled respondents from the two study villages of
        Karkar Island in our analyses, knowledge of grouper spawning
        aggregations was higher (by 52%, based on the sum fisher knowledge index
        for both grouper species) among Muluk fishers than neighbouring fishers
        from Wadau. Since fishers exhibit similar dependency on fishing, this
        finding may reflect the differing historical context of two communities,
        which may have settled on the coast at different times

        This study demonstrated the utility of PSA in examining how attributes
        relating to catchability and socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort
        influence the susceptibility of reef fish populations to aggregation
        fishing. Given that experts with access to scientific information have
        scored susceptibility indictors in previous applications of PSA

        , our study is also novel in that information to score indicators was
        sourced directly from resource users. Such an approach is more
        applicable to the many coral reef fisheries that lack fisheries and
        ecological information.

        . It is therefore appropriate to incorporate fisher knowledge as an
        indicator of susceptibility to fishing in risk analyses involving
        aggregating species, especially as it varies among communities

        . At Karkar, encounterability was higher and the main reef habitats were
        available for access by all fishers, including the outer reef slopes
        that are the typical aggregation habitat of at least three of our study
        species (

        ). However, knowledge of aggregating behaviour was less well developed
        than on Ahus. The selectivity of gears for many species was greater on
        Ahus, particularly in their use of a form of muro-ami to target
        snappers, whereby scare lines and nets are used to corral fish into an
        enclosed space where they are taken by speargun. This fishing technique
        is highly efficient for shoaling and schooling fish such as

        , as evidenced by the higher catch rates at Ahus. Thus, after combining
        fisher knowledge with availability, encounterability and selectivity,
        study populations were assessed as equally susceptible to aggregation
        fishing at Ahus and Karkar using the catchability approach of Hobday et
        al. (2011)

        An advantage of PSA is that the susceptibility attributes included can
        be adapted to local contexts or issues of importance. For example,

      - ' developed 22 susceptibility index indicators in a PSA, including attributes relating to socioeconomic drivers of fishing pressure (termed ‘management’ attributes). This proved important to our analysis since the use of catchability attributes alone did not separate study locations, whereas the inclusion of socioeconomic drivers identified a greater potential for overfishing of aggregating populations at Ahus. These drivers are known indicators of fishing pressure and resource depletion '

        that drive demand for marine resources and may lead to greater targeting
        of reef fish aggregations.

        PSA and other semi-quantitative approaches are, however, sensitive to
        the assumptions made in developing indicators

        . A number of assumptions had to be made in our application for
        aggregation-based fisheries. For example, our proxy for encounterability
        assumed that if a species appeared in a fisher's catch, then the gears
        used by that fisher were equally likely to encounter the species in
        aggregations if conditions of availability were met. This may be
        justified if aggregations did not form at depths beyond those typically
        fished by the gear, which would presumably affect fishers using gears
        that are generally constrained to shallower water (i.e. spearguns and
        nets) than fishers using lines. Our measure of availability was coarse
        but necessary in a data-poor context with limited time for observations
        on the spatial distribution of fishing effort. The use of CPUE to
        estimate selectivity was also subject to uncertainty, given the numerous
        factors that affect this parameter, and essentially constituted a
        measure of gear efficiency for a species rather than selectivity

        . Further development of indicator-based frameworks for
        aggregation-based reef fisheries may improve on our methods for
        estimating susceptibility to fishing.

        An additional caveat in the use of indicator-based approaches is that
        they can be overly reductionist in attempting to simplify complex
        socio-ecological systems. Consequently, PSA can be combined with more
        detailed social, economic or ecological research to better understand
        the management implications of more complex interactions that indicators
        fail to capture. It is ideally applied as a participatory risk
        assessment tool for supporting communication, promoting understanding,
        building consensus and prioritizing actions as part of community-based
        management planning. In our application of this tool, five populations
        were identified to be at medium risk from aggregation fishing. However,
        a participatory application of PSA in the two communities may have
        yielded different results. For example, resource users could develop
        their own indicators or choose to weight indicators according to their
        own priorities

        estimates for the study populations are absent. However, multispecies

        To conclude, heterogeneity in fisher knowledge relating to reef fish
        aggregating behaviour will be influenced by social, economic and
        cultural factors that are specific to the local context. Understanding
        how knowledge is structured within a community will be important if
        customary practices for conservation, such as

While knowledge alone does not imply that fishers will maximize extraction from a fishery, shifts in socioeconomic drivers may serve to increase fishing pressure. For example, a breakdown in ownership rights and resulting spread of knowledge among kinship groups has been identified as a cause for concern in relation to pressure on spawning aggregations in PNG '
