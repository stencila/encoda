    Reef fishes that exhibit predictable aggregating behaviour are often
    considered vulnerable to overexploitation. However, fisher knowledge of this
    behaviour is often heterogeneous and, coupled with socioeconomic factors
    that constrain demand for or access to aggregated fish, will influence
    susceptibility to fishing. At two case study locations in Papua New Guinea,
    Ahus and Karkar islands, we conducted interview-based surveys to examine how
    local context influenced heterogeneity in knowledge of fish aggregations. We
    then explored the role of fisher knowledge in conferring susceptibility to
    fishing relative to socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort. Local
    heterogeneity in knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed between our
    case studies. At Ahus, variable access rights among fishers and genders to
    the main habitats were sources of heterogeneity in knowledge. By contrast,
    knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the sole source of variation was
    gear type. Differences between locations in the susceptibility of
    aggregations to fishing depended primarily on socioeconomic drivers of
    fishing effort rather than catchability. While Ahus fishers were
    knowledgeable of fish aggregations and used more selective gears, Karkar
    fishers were less constrained by tenure in their access to aggregation
    habitat. However, fishing effort was greater at Ahus and likely related to
    high dependency on fishing, greater access to provincial capital markets
    than Karkar and a weakening of customary management. Moreover, highly
    efficient fishing techniques have emerged at Ahus to exploit the
    non-reproductive aggregating behaviour of target species. Understanding how
    knowledge is structured within fishing communities and its relation to
    socioeconomic drivers of fishing effort is important if customary practices
    for conservation, such as

        The depletion of reef fish biomass is often attributed to overfishing
        driven by socioeconomic drivers such as local human population density
        and distance from reefs to markets

        . As changes to these key socioeconomic drivers increase demand for
        resources, reef fishes with slow life histories, such as groupers
        (Serranidae), are typically the first to be depleted

        . However, the rate of depletion will also be influenced by the ability
        of fishers to locate and exploit fish populations when they are most
        vulnerable to fishing. Vulnerability to fishing increases when fish
        aggregate or school and the history of fishing is marked by developments
        based on exploiting this aspect of fish behaviour

        The exploitation of reef fish spawning aggregations is an obvious
        example of fishers utilising knowledge on fish behaviour to target
        populations when their density has increased. A large number of
        important food fishes on coral reefs aggregate periodically at high
        density to spawn

        local socioeconomic indicators?, and (3), what is the influence of

        knowledge on aggregating behaviour and to develop an index of knowledge

        Karkar, interviews were conducted with all fishers for whom fishing was

        residents engaged in fishing was high by comparison, a sample of

        Firstly, species recognition by fishers was established using a
        combination of pictures (landed specimens) and local names specific to
        location. Secondly, we asked fishers whether they caught each species
        frequently, infrequently or not at all and, if they encountered the
        species, to estimate the ‘poor’, ‘normal’ and ‘good’ catch rates
        (fish.trip
      - type: Superscript
        content:
          - −1
      - >-
        ) that they typically obtain for each species when using their primary
        gear. Thirdly, fishers were questioned on their knowledge of aggregating
        behaviour, initially focusing on whether they observe a species to
        display solitary, shoaling (groups of three or more fish displaying
        unsynchronised swimming) and schooling (groups of three or more fish
        displaying synchronised swimming) behaviour

        . Fishers could assign multiple behavioural types to each species,
        giving eight potential categories including a ‘don't know’ response. For
        example, a species could be identified as solitary and shoaling, or as
        displaying all three behaviour types. Unless specified, ‘aggregation’
        refers to all forms (i.e. shoaling, schooling) and functions (e.g.
        resting) of social group behaviour.

        Seven attributes of the spatial, temporal and physical manifestations of
        aggregating behaviour were employed to quantify fisher knowledge of
        aggregations and their perceived predictability (
      - type: Link
        relation: table

        content:
          - Table 2
      - >-
        ). Aggregation attributes were discussed for each species and scored
        according to fisher responses. For some statistical tests and analyses (
      - type: Emphasis
        content:
          - see below
      - >-
        ), an index of fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour was calculated
        for each fisher and species by summing the scores for the seven
        aggregation attributes (maximum score = 17; 
      - type: Link
        relation: table

        content:
          - Table 2
      - >-
        ). Thus, the fisher knowledge index essentially aims to measure the
        predictability of aggregations as perceived by fishers. For example, to
        obtain a maximum score, a fisher would need to recognise that
        aggregations form consistently at specific locations within a small home
        range, that formation aligns with diel, lunar and seasonal schedules,
        that aggregations are large (>500 fish), and that they form for spawning
        (
      - type: Link
        relation: table

        content:
          - Table 2
      - >-
        ). Aggregation size and spawning (presence of eggs or milt) are physical
        manifestations of behaviour that were assumed to promote recall and
        therefore perceived predictability. Since some species were reported as
        constantly shoaling or schooling, questions on periodicities of
        aggregation formation were obviously irrelevant. Therefore, fishers were
        asked as to whether aggregation size in frequently shoaling or schooling
        species (e.g. 
      - type: Emphasis
        content:

        that a specific gear will encounter aggregated fish if sites are
        available to fishers. Fisher responses to the question on whether they
        catch the species frequently, infrequently or not at all were used as a
        measure of encounterability, assuming that the gears used by that fisher
        would be as efficient in catching the fish while aggregated. Thirdly, to
        measure selectivity, i.e. the potential of the gear to capture and
        retain species, we used fisher reports of catch rates (fish.trip

        gear used for a species, from which gear selectivity was ranked by order
        of catch rate. Fourthly, we replaced post-capture mortality

        Several methods were employed to examine how fisher knowledge of

        and aggregation attribute, fisher respondent scores were averaged in
        each location and the difference between the averages (Ahus minus
        Karkar) plotted. Secondly, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare

        averaged across fishers for each location and the same statistical
        method as that applied to individual aggregation attributes was used.
        For statistical tests of variation in both individual aggregation
        attributes and in the fisher knowledge index, comparisons were
        restricted to those fishers knowledgeable on the species and its

        each case study as the two locations differ significantly in their
        socioeconomic conditions and the aim was to examine local sources of
        variation in fisher knowledge. Here, all fisher respondents for a
        location were included in the analysis (n = 16) since variation in
        knowledge was integral to the analysis. However, results for Ahus should
        be treated with caution since sample size relative to the number of
        indicator (factor) levels imposed limitations on the RDA. Access to
        habitat was not included in the RDA for Karkar since it did not vary

        Estimates of productivity attributes were averaged to give a single
        productivity score per species. To assess the relative importance of
        catchability and socioeconomic drivers of fishing pressure for the six
        species, each susceptibility attribute was first scored for each fisher
        respondent individually and then averaged across fishers to give a
        single attribute score for each location. Within location, the
        susceptibility attributes were combined by averaging across two sets of
        attributes; (1) the full set of 10 susceptibility attributes, and (2)
        the four catchability attributes (

        populations (six species per location), one for productivity and the
        full set of susceptibility attributes, and a second for productivity and
        using only the four catchability attributes (we only present the PSA
        plot for the full set of susceptibility attributes). From both of these
        PSA plots, overall vulnerability (or risk) was derived for each

        the origin and population location in the bivariate space

        location averaged 93 hours of fishing each month compared to 58 hours at
        Karkar. Dependency on fishing was also higher, with more than 80% of
        fishers reporting fishing as their primary livelihood compared to 12.5%
        at Karkar. The majority of fishers at Ahus also reported that they use
        scare lines for catching snappers, ensuring that habitat impacts were
        also comparatively high at that location. Moreover, fishers from Ahus
        regularly accessed markets of neighbouring villages (neighbouring
        islands and the northern coast of Manus) and the provincial capital,
        whereas fishers from Karkar generally traded locally or occasionally in
        neighbouring villages on Karkar. Ownership rights and customary reef
        closure measures still existed at Karkar, but at Ahus fishers reported
        during interviews that the customary closure was no longer being
        respected or complied with. Consequently, including attributes relating
        to socioeconomic drivers resulted in a greater susceptibility of
        aggregations to fishing at Ahus compared to Karkar.

        , we found that fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour varied between
        our two case study communities. While this finding is unsurprising in a
        country of such high cultural and socioeconomic diversity, our study
        makes a contribution by also highlighting the influence of local context
        in structuring knowledge within communities. Thus, the relatively high
        heterogeneity in knowledge at Ahus related to rights of access among
        fishers and genders to the main habitats of the relatively large reef
        system. By contrast, knowledge was more homogenous at Karkar and the
        sole source of variation was primary gear type. Though knowledge of
        aggregation location and timing are prerequisites for exploitation,
        factors that drive fishing effort will ultimately determine their
        susceptibility to fishing since knowledge, by itself, does not ensure
        that fishers will seek to maximize their extraction from the fishery

        Fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour was particularly heterogeneous
        at Ahus. Since variation at Ahus related to gender and access to reef
        habitats, it appears to stem from the decentralised tenure system that
        specifies ownership rights to space, species, gear and the techniques
        for using gears among kinship groups

        . With less specialisation in specific gears or habitats, knowledge was
        less structured at Karkar compared to Ahus, as indicated by the
        relatively low amount of variation explained by the redundancy analysis.
        Heterogeneity in knowledge was unrelated to dependency on fishing, which
        at Ahus resulted from the fact that fishing was the primary livelihood
        for 80% of fishers, encompassing both genders and fishers with differing
        right of access. Though our objective was to explore local sources of
        variation in knowledge, dependency on fishing may explain why fishing
        effort was higher and fishers used more efficient gears (i.e. scare
        lines) at Ahus.

        Variation in fisher knowledge of aggregating behaviour differed among
        the three families of reef fish. Compared to emperors and groupers,
        knowledge of aggregations of the two snappers was greater and relatively
        homogenous. Snapper aggregation locations were perceived by fishers as
        spatially predictable and were associated with particular features of
        the reef, corresponding with empirical evidence for these species

        within communities, but was limited to a small number of socioeconomic
        indicators that reflect the contemporary context of the two communities.
        Consequently, we did not quantify important historical aspects of these
        communities and the role of oral histories in transferring knowledge,

        example, though we pooled respondents from the two study villages of

        aggregations was higher (by 52%, based on the sum fisher knowledge index
        for both grouper species) among Muluk fishers than neighbouring fishers
        from Wadau. Since fishers exhibit similar dependency on fishing, this
        finding may reflect the differing historical context of two communities,

        that drive demand for marine resources and may lead to greater targeting
        of reef fish aggregations.

        . A number of assumptions had to be made in our application for
        aggregation-based fisheries. For example, our proxy for encounterability
        assumed that if a species appeared in a fisher's catch, then the gears
        used by that fisher were equally likely to encounter the species in
        aggregations if conditions of availability were met. This may be
        justified if aggregations did not form at depths beyond those typically
        fished by the gear, which would presumably affect fishers using gears
        that are generally constrained to shallower water (i.e. spearguns and
        nets) than fishers using lines. Our measure of availability was coarse
        but necessary in a data-poor context with limited time for observations
        on the spatial distribution of fishing effort. The use of CPUE to
        estimate selectivity was also subject to uncertainty, given the numerous
        factors that affect this parameter, and essentially constituted a
        measure of gear efficiency for a species rather than selectivity

        aggregation-based reef fisheries may improve on our methods for
        estimating susceptibility to fishing.

        An additional caveat in the use of indicator-based approaches is that
        they can be overly reductionist in attempting to simplify complex
        socio-ecological systems. Consequently, PSA can be combined with more
        detailed social, economic or ecological research to better understand
        the management implications of more complex interactions that indicators
        fail to capture. It is ideally applied as a participatory risk
        assessment tool for supporting communication, promoting understanding,
        building consensus and prioritizing actions as part of community-based
        management planning. In our application of this tool, five populations
        were identified to be at medium risk from aggregation fishing. However,
        a participatory application of PSA in the two communities may have
        yielded different results. For example, resource users could develop
        their own indicators or choose to weight indicators according to their
        own priorities

        To conclude, heterogeneity in fisher knowledge relating to reef fish
        aggregating behaviour will be influenced by social, economic and
        cultural factors that are specific to the local context. Understanding
        how knowledge is structured within a community will be important if
        customary practices for conservation, such as
