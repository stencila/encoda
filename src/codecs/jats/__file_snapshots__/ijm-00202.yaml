        This article analyses the gender differences in the Personal Income Tax
        in Uruguay. Although the tax code does not explicitly specify gender
        differences, the average tax rate varies among gendered household types.
        Using post-tax income data, we simulate the average tax rate of the
        household and estimate a zero-one inflated beta model -which properly
        addresses the fact that the average tax rate includes many zero data
        points- to analyse it. We find that household supported by a one-earner
        couple bear a higher tax burden than the ones supported by a dual-earner
        couple or a single parent. We interpret that these findings suggest that
        the tax serves as somewhat of an incentive towards equal gender time
        allocation within the family, which is consistent with gender equity.
        However the strengths of the tax system from the gender perspective are
        eroded by the possibility to opt for a (rarely used) joint filing.

        ). Under this rule, the second earner (typically women) effectively pays
        a higher tax (on her income) than if she was taxed individually, because
        of increasing marginal rates. This pattern is criticized for different
        reasons. For example, it is at odds with policy recommendations derived
        from the optimal taxation perspective, in which individuals with higher
        labour supply elasticity should be less taxed. As married women have a
        more elastic labour supply than their spouses, tax rates on labour
        income should be lower for women than for men (

        the participation of married women in the labour market and men’s
        participation in unpaid domestic work, creating gender biases (

Indeed, a dual earner couple has to purchase household services in the market or forgo leisure time compared with the traditional male breadwinner couple. Thus, a similar welfare level of a household may lead to a higher burden PIT for a dual than one earner couple. A similar argument holds when comparing male breadwinner and lone parent families. However, not all who advocate gender equity give support to taxes on home production because of distributive concerns, on the understanding that it would increase more the tax burden of low than high income households ('

        In recent decades, there has been a trend in developed countries to

        However, gender tax burden differences may be observed even under
        individual filing and a schedular system as reported in several
        empirical studies (see

        The purpose of this study is to analyse the gender differences in the
        PIT-to-income ratio in Uruguay. The PIT was created in 2007 when a
        left-coalition was running the administration for the first time in the
        Uruguayan history, and in 2013, it accounted for 10% of public revenue.
        The PIT was the result of a commitment during the campaign to improve
        the distributive effect of the tax system. The debate about tax reform
        did not raise issues related to gender equity and in fact, this is the
        first analysis that addresses it. However, the PIT design reflects the
        general spirit of the latest reforms in developed countries that help to
        mitigate gender biases. Labour income, pensions and capital income are
        subject to a differentiated schedule tax, with marginal progressive
        rates for the first and second sources and a flat rate for capital
        income. Individual filing is the norm but joint taxation is also
        allowed, and there are no explicit gender biases in the code.

        . The main difference with the first of these studies is that we use
        actual data instead of simulations of representative agents. Compared to
        the second study, which uses survey data as in this paper, our main
        innovation is to use an econometric strategy for the analysis.
  - type: Paragraph

        We use the Household Survey carried out in 2013 by the Statistical
        Office in Uruguay. The survey reports post-tax income. Therefore, we
        simulate taxes and contributions using the statutory rates in force in
        2013, and we add them to the reported income in order to have a proxy of
        gross income. We estimate the average tax rate of the household as
        PIT-to-gross income ratio taking into account paid taxes and income of
        all household earners. As we work with a database of individuals, we
        assign the same tax rate to all household members.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        We classify the households according to a combination of dimensions:
        whether or not the household head has a partner, employment status of
        the head and partner (if any), and whether or not it is an extended
        household. We are particularly interested in comparing the average tax
        rate in three typical cases: a) households supported by a male worker
        and a housewife who is not engaged in paid employment, b) households in
        which both members of the couple participate in the labour market, and
        c) households in which a single woman works in the labour market. We
        also compare households of non-employed individuals, ie, pensioners. We
        assess the effect of household type on the average tax rate by
        estimating a zero-one inflated beta model (ZOIB). This model properly
        addresses the fact that the average tax rate is a proportion with
        presence of zeros.

        , we consider this result to be consistent with gender equality because
        it is in line with more equal gender time allocation within the family.
        However, male breadwinner households also bear a higher tax incidence
        than female breadwinner households with a dependent spouse. This gender
        difference mainly comes from their different structure of income
        sources. The households headed by a single female worker exhibit a lower
        PIT incidence mainly due to the high share of non-taxed sources in their
        household income. Finally, we do not find gender differences within
        pensioners.

        These results are based on the assumption that everybody files taxes
        individually. This assumption is quite realistic because joint filing is
        rarely used. Joint filing has not been analysed in Uruguay and probably
        its non-use is partly due to lack of information. However, joint filing
        is preferable for households in which one spouse does not participate in
        the labour market and for a percentage of the households in which both
        members of the couple do. Thus, as a robustness check for the basic
        results, we estimate gender gaps under the assumption that households
        opt for joint filing when it allows them to pay lower taxes than under
        individual filing. Though gender equity is eroded, we come up with the
        same conclusions.

        The main contributions of this work are a) the implementation of a new
        strategy to analyse the data in the study of gender and taxation and b)
        the presentation of evidence about the gendered differences in the PIT
        burden in a developing country which last decade passed a tax reform
        that follows the main guidelines of regimes in advanced economies.

        The remainder of this study proceeds as follows. In the next section we
        provide a description of the Uruguayan economy, after that we present
        the data and methodology and then we report the main results of the
        analysis. In the final section we conclude.

        At the beginning of the 20th century, the country had low fertility and
        high life expectancy compared to Latin American standards. Since then,
        fertility has decreased and life expectancy has increased, and Uruguay
        is now in an advanced stage of demographic transition. Around 14 per
        cent of the population is older than 64 years of age as compared to less
        than 7 per cent on average in Latin America (see

        this difference is even larger among workers because female labour
        participation increases with education. The socio-demographic changes
        have impacted household structures to the extent that they are
        substantially different from the Latin American average. Since the aging

        In sum, this brief picture shows that women are very much involved in
        the economy, and thus they were affected by the creation of the Personal
        Income Tax. However, the effect of PIT is different for women and men if

        ). Part of it is due to gender differences in time spent in labour
        market: working hours per week were on average 32 for women and more
        than 40 for men. Other portion is related to gender differences in
        labour income per hour: in 2006–2013, the average value of (post-tax)
        per hour labour income gender gap oscillated around 6% of male labour
        income. Previous studies for Uruguay show that the gender gap subsists
        after controlling individual observable characteristics and that the
        discrimination measures have been stable in the last two decades (

        Finally, an important question as regards the PIT burden is to examine
        gender differences in evasion patterns. We have information about the
        incidence of non-contribution to social security among workers. As
        contributions are compulsory for all workers, lack of contribution is a
        good proxy of PIT evasion. The incidence of non-contribution declined
        from 35% to 26% of employment between 2006 and 2013. This decline may be
        explained by the combination of growth and the strengthening of controls
        of the Administration. During all the period, the incidence of lack of
        contribution was similar for women and men.

        In 2004, for the first time in Uruguayan history, national elections
        were won by a left coalition. The new administration that entered into
        office in 2005 was strongly committed with the reduction of inequality
        and poverty, and to carry out reforms of the tax and benefits system.
        One of the main pledges during the political campaign was to increase
        tax progressivity without changing the average tax burden. In 2007 the
        government passed a Tax Reform that increased the weight of progressive
        direct taxes at the expense of indirect taxes. Besides introducing
        changes in the indirect tax system, the reform created a Personal Income
        Tax that reflected the spirit of the latest reforms that were proposed
        and debated in developed countries.

        First, it was designed as an individual filing system without explicit
        gender bias. The possibility to opt for joint taxation was introduced in
        2009 and is only allowed for labour income received by married couples
        or those in a consensual union. Though there is no information about the
        percentage of couples that choose this option, administrative records
        make it possible to estimate it. The Tax Office provides information of
        the number of tax units registered as taxpayers (including exempted and
        non-exempted ones) of the PIT labour income component. These tax units
        include workers that choose individual filing (

        Second, PIT was conceived as a dual tax under which capital income was
        taxed at a flat rate whereas labour income and pensions were subjected
        to progressive rates. Some months after its introduction, litigious
        issues led to taking out pensions and creating a progressive tax
        specific to them. In this study we refer to the PIT, including on
        pensions. The government justified the dual income tax because of the
        difficulties of tracing non-domestic sources of income, the prevention
        of lobbying activities and the high risk of evasion (

        ). With regard to the topic of concern in this study, a relevant
        characteristic of the dual structure is that a flat rate on capital

        household members, which has potential gender consequences.

        Deductions are allowed for bad debts, real estate taxes, and the cost of

        rent and no other deductions are allowed. The agencies that administer

        The tax credits are comprised of worker contributions and taxes levied

        disabled child) and mortgage payments when the house is used for
        permanent residence and its cost is lower than a threshold. The tax
        credit for children can be distributed between parents. When parents are
        divorced and they do not agree about this distribution, each one can
        deduct 50 per cent. In order to calculate the amount of the tax credit,
        a progressive rate schedule applies that ranges from 10 per cent in the
        first bracket to 30 per cent in the sixth. After subtracting these tax
        credits, tenants are allowed to additionally subtract 6 per cent of
        their rent. If this deduction generates a surplus, this surplus is not
        refunded by the tax office and cannot be transferred to the following
        year.

        For most income levels, the tax burden is higher for pensioners than

        no tax-free threshold for pensions. Among workers, the highest burden
        corresponds to a single person without children followed by a single
        person with one child. To calculate the tax burden of a single parent
        worker with one child we assumed that he/she makes 100 per cent use of
        the child deduction. The tax burden is a bit lower when the parent of a
        child is married or in union. Although there are no explicit legal
        differences, the single worker pays a higher share of income as PIT
        because contributions to the health system (eligible for tax credits)
        are lower for them than for married people. Finally, the lowest burden
        corresponds to a married worker with a child who is paying a mortgage
        equal to the maximum permitted value for the tax credit.

        . Because of the findings by Vigorito & Esponda when comparing ECH and
        Tax Office records, we expect that this is a reasonable assumption to
        estimate gross labour income of workers who do not evade their PIT
        payments. However we cannot assess the accuracy of labour income
        reported in the survey by evaders. Regarding PIT credits, we considered
        contributions and child benefits, but we did not impute deductions
        related to mortgages and rents due to the lack of information for an
        appropriate assumption. Credits for children were assigned to the head
        of the household who is usually the household member who receives the
        highest income.

        When estimating the amount of PIT paid we assumed that individuals opt
        for individual filing because joint filing is rarely used. Besides, the
        survey does not provide any information that would help distinguish
        couples that used different options. Thus, we performed a first analysis
        using estimations of gross income and PIT based on individual filing.
        Then, to analyse the effect of the joint filing option we estimated the
        amount of PIT under joint filing given the already estimated gross
        income.

        To analyse sources of income we deflated them by the Consumer Price
        Index and classified them into four groups: capital income, labour
        income, other income (public and private transfers plus
        self-consumption), and imputed rental value of owner-occupied houses).

      - 3.2. Gendered classification of the population
  - type: Paragraph

        Personal income taxes are generally applied to individuals. However,
        studies on inequality and distributive effects of taxes chose the
        household as the proper unit of analysis under the understanding that
        household members share income and other resources. As our focus is the
        analysis of gendered distributive effects, the challenge is to provide
        an appropriate gender classification of households. To address the issue
        about the effects on allocation of time between labour market and home
        production and to take into account lack or time of lone parents, we are
        interested on identifying the typical cases of one-earner couple,
        two-earner couple and single female earner. Besides, we want to compare
        similar types of one-earner couple and single earner but supported by
        earners of different gender. Finally, in developing countries we have to
        take into account the existence of extended households (households where
        there are members related by other links than children or partner such
        as grand-parents, brothers-in-law, nephews, non-relatives, etc.) whose
        gendered nature is difficult to be captured.

        Thus, we made a classification of the population that takes into account
        the household structure and the employment status of household members.

        We first distinguish extended from non-extended households (that are
        comprised of single individuals or couples, with or without children at
        any age). We distinguish eight household types within each group. In the

        Three categories represent the typical cases that are of interest from
        the gender perspective of tax studies. The “couple, male breadwinner”
        category includes non-extended households formed by a couple (with or
        without children) in which only the male participates in the labour
        market. Around 19 per cent of individuals live in this type of
        household. The “single, female breadwinner” category consists of a
        non-extended household headed by a single worker woman, and accounts for
        7.8 per cent of population. The “couple, dual earner” category
        corresponds to non-extended households formed by a couple in which both
        the male and female work in the labour market. This category is the most
        frequent, accounting for 30.7 per cent of individuals.

        We aim to identify gender differences in the PIT burden and also to
        examine the role of some specific household characteristics in the
        explanation of those differences. A particular issue in our study is
        that the main variable of interest, the PIT-to-income ratio, includes
        many observations of 0 and no 1 seconds (no household is taxed at 100%).
        These zeros can provide important information for the study of the
        lowest levels of taxation and they are included for theoretical and
        empirical reasons. Hence, we conduct the empirical analysis considering
        a dependent variable that assumes values in the interval [0, 1) and
        contains excess of zeros.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:

        In a case like this, the dependent variable is not symmetrically
        distributed, so the predicted values of the linear regression model may
        lie outside the unit interval. As an alternative,

        In practice, the beta distribution is not suitable for modelling data
        that contains zeros or ones. But we want to consider observations where
        the dependent variable is zero. Therefore, we apply a combination of two
        distributions: a beta distribution when the variable is bounded by 0 and
        1, and another distribution function that is in effect when the variable
        takes the value 0. For a detailed description of this methodology see

        Our explanatory variable of interest is a vector of dummy variables that
        captures household type, which provides the gendered classification of
        the population. We also use several variables that reflect household
        characteristics: the household per capita income, a dummy variable that
        takes a value equal to one when there is at least one member younger
        than 18 in the household, the household size, the number of earners per
        household and the lack of contribution to social security measured as
        the ratio of the number of workers that are not contributors and the
        number of workers in the household (the ratio takes value 0 when there
        are no workers in the household). Additionally, we break down the
        household income by source in order to separately capture the incidence
        of all sources: capital income, labour income, pensions, other income
        (public and private transfers plus self-consumption) and rental value.
        The choice of these variables responds to the fact that they may explain
        differences in the PIT burden due to the characteristics of the tax
        detailed in Section 2.2. In particular, we aim to capture progressivity,
        the treatment to the different sources of income and the design of
        credits and deductions.

        We compute and report the marginal effects of the dependent variables on
        the PIT-to-income ratio. In the case of the household type vector, the
        effect is the discrete effect of moving from “couple, dual earner” to
        each respective other household type. For the other variables, the
        effect is measured for the “couple, dual earner” household, valuing the
        rest of the variables at their mean.

        The PIT is a progressive tax. Its Kakwani index is positive (0.360) and
        the Gini index declines from 0.426 pre-tax to 0.413 post-tax, reflecting
        the PIT’s equalizing effect. However, the distributive effect is limited
        because of the tax size and exemptions. Around 54% of the population
        lives in households that do not pay the tax, and the average PIT burden
        is 1.8% population wide and 3.9% among the population of households who
        face this tax.

        At the top we show the five types of non-extended working households.
        The “couple, dual earner” category bears the largest PIT burden (2.4%)
        and has the highest proportion of taxpayers (61%). The “couple, dual
        earner” category is followed by male breadwinner households which have
        an average burden of 2% when living with no partner and 1.8% when living
        with a partner. Finally, the lowest burden corresponds to female
        breadwinner types: 1.5% when in union or married and 1.2% when single.

        the “couple, non-employed” type with an average burden of 1.5% whereas
        the single types pay an average of 1% of income in the form of the PIT.
        There are no significant gender differences between single types.

        The purpose of the PIT is progressivity, so a proper analysis needs to
        control the results by income. Thus, we estimate Model two in which we
        add per capita gross income as a control. As expected, the PIT burden
        increases with income. The difference in income levels by household type
        affects the order of the three typical cases: now, the “couple, male
        breadwinner” type has the highest PIT-to-income ratio, followed by
        “couple, dual earner” and “single, female breadwinner”.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        These results are consistent with gender equality although we do not
        know (and we do not address the study of) the optimal magnitude of the
        gaps. The lower tax burden among dual earner than among male breadwinner
        households does not discourage female labour market participation. Also,
        there would be a fairness concern if the one earner household receives a
        better treatment than a female without a spouse. Nelson’s argument is
        behind this gender equity concept: given income, welfare depends on the
        capacity of household’s production which is not taxed.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        Besides the three typical types, there are two other comparisons that
        may help to understand gender differences: “couple, male breadwinner” vs
        “couple, female breadwinner” and “single, female breadwinner” vs
        “single, male breadwinner”. Both female types bear a lower tax burden
        than male types.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        To analyse the PIT ratio differences between household types, we
        estimate Model three in which we include possible sources of those
        differences: presence of children, household size, number of earners and
        the lack of contribution to social security (a proxy of the percentage
        of worker tax evaders in the household). Also, the explanatory variable
        of income is split into several sources. As shown in

        content:
          - Table 3

        , even after including all the variables that may explain the
        differences, the gaps decline although they do not vanish. .
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        Let’s analyse the demographic controls. The tax burden is higher when
        there are children in the household and increases with household size.
        This result is not surprising: on the one hand, the tax burden is likely
        to increase with total household income because of the progressivity of
        marginal tax rates on pensions and labour earnings; on the other hand,
        in each level of per capita household income, total income of the
        household increases with its size. As the average values of household
        size and presence of children are higher for “couple, male breadwinner”
        than “couple, dual earner”, the PIT burden tends to be higher for the
        former
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        We interpret that the presence of children and the household size are
        demographic characteristics mainly related to life-cycle stage. But tax
        evasion and the income sources are at least partially influenced by
        culture and socioeconomic arrangements, so the interpretation of the PIT
        ratio differences should be interpreted cautiously from a gender
        perspective.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        The effect of the number of earners is negative because of the
        progressivity of marginal taxes. I.e., at a given level of income, the
        PIT-to-income ratio is lower when the number of members receiving income
        is higher. As the number of earners is lower in the “couple, male
        breadwinner” category than the “couple, dual earner” category, the
        variable contributes to a higher gap between these types.

        Unsurprisingly, the lack of contribution (tax evasion) has a negative
        effect. As it is higher in “couple, male breadwinner” than in “couple,
        dual earner” households, different behaviour patterns in tax evasion do
        not contribute to explain the tax burden gap.

        Finally, the marginal effects by income source indicate that the tax
        burden decreases when households are supported by non-taxable income
        (transfers and rental value). These sources are very important within
        the female type households so they contribute to explain their lower PIT
        burden. Public transfers are an important part of the non-taxable
        income. In Uruguay, most of the public programs of monetary transfers
        are directed to low-resources families. So, our findings suggest that
        the incidence of low income households is higher among female than male
        types. The share of non-taxable income is 13% among “couple, dual
        earner” but 25% for “single, female breadwinner”. In turn, for the
        “single, male breadwinner”, which tax burden is higher than its female
        counterpart, the non-taxable income accounts for 16% of their income.
        Finally, the incidence of non-taxed income for “couple, female
        breadwinner” (22%) is higher than for “couple, male breadwinner” (18%).

        These results reflect the average situation. We also did an estimation

        the income sources. In

      - ' we report the predicted PIT burden across the per capita income distribution for “couple, dual earner”, “couple, male breadwinner” and “single, female breadwinner”. The average depicted pattern is clearly identified in the central range of the income distribution: between the 25th and 75th percentile, the “couple, male breadwinner” type bears the highest burden whereas the “single, female breadwinner” exhibits the lowest one. But over the 75th percentile, the difference between the curves for the “couple, dual earner” and the “couple, male breadwinner” categories are not statistically significant at conventional levels. Meanwhile, “single, female breadwinner” has the lowest burden level across the entire distribution, although the magnitude of the gap is lower at the tails.'

      - >-
        Up to now we assumed that all individuals opt for individual filing. In
        this section we estimate the PIT amounts that would be paid under joint
        filing if we assume that couples choose the lowest burden option. Remind
        that we estimated that 5.4% of couples in the Tax Office records chose
        joint filing in 2013. In our simulation we find that 17% of the
        households with a labour income source (12% of total households) would
        benefit by choosing joint instead of individual filing. Thus, this
        estimation is much higher than the one based on tax records.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        According to our simulation, joint filing is not only the best choice
        for the “couple, male breadwinner” type but also for one quarter of the
        “couple, dual earner” households in the database that pay PIT.

            ‘marginal effect’ by household type compared to the “couple, dual

        The patterns between models are similar to those obtained under the
        assumption of individual filing. Model two indicates that the “couple,
        male breadwinner” type bears the highest burden, followed by “couple,
        dual earner” and “single, female breadwinner”. But the gap between
        “couple, male breadwinner” and “couple, dual earner” is smaller than
        under individual filing. This suggests that joint filing helps to offset
        the incentives of sharing labour market work between spouses implicit in
        individual filing. Also the difference between “single, female
        breadwinner” and “couple, dual earner” becomes smaller. This is due to
        the gains for some “couple, dual earner” households opting for joint
        filing.

        The estimation of Model two indicates that the “couple, non-employed”
        type bears a lower burden than the “couple, dual earner” type (a
        significant marginal effect of –0.0087). This difference between types
        responds mainly to the fact that households of non-employed are formed
        by small households of elders. Thus, a similar per capita income means a
        higher total income for the “couple, dual earner” type. Once we control
        by the demographic variables, the marginal effect of “couple,
        non-employed” is positive. Indeed, the elders tend to face a higher PIT
        burden because they are more likely supported by pensions and capital
        income than labour income.

        Gender issues have been debated in the policy agenda of social security
        system and led to some modifications such as the use of similar
        mortality rates for women and men to calculate the retirement pension,
        and the computation for women of one year per child in the calculus of
        the number of years of contribution required to retire. Feminist
        movements also claim the reduction of indirect taxes is some female
        goods, especially the ones linked to reproductive health.

        In this study, we analyse the gendered effects of the PIT in Uruguay.
        The PIT was introduced ten years ago by a left government and the
        discussions about it (before and after its creation) are centred on its
        distributive effect. However, gender equity has not been raised in this
        debate.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        The analysis of the legislation indicates that there are no explicit
        gender differences in the code, which means that the PIT treats women
        and men on an equal basis regarding rates, credits and deductions. There
        is a flat tax rate for capital income and two different progressive
        schedules for pensions and labour income. It is a joint filing system
        though joint system is allowed for couple income. On the base of Tax
        records we estimate that only 5.4% of couples (with at least one labour
        income earner) used the joint filing option in 2013. This low incidence
        may be explained by the lack of incentives to opt for joint filing.
        However, on the base of survey data, we estimate that 17% of couples
        (with at least one labour income earner) would benefit for joint filing.
        We cannot assess the difference between these two estimations. Note that
        there are not simple rules (such ranges of income level or ranges of
        participation of one spouse in the couple’s labour income), except the
        case of one earner couples, to inform the population who benefit or not
        of joint filing. Thus, a possible explanation of the discrepancy is lack
        of information. Indeed, every year couples have to calculate their PIT
        payments under individual and joint filing to opt for the least costly.
        But there are probably other explanations that could be the scope of
        future research.

        We conduct the analysis using microdata provided by the 2013 Household
        Survey. We estimated taxes and contributions using the statutory rates
        in force in 2013. There is an important limitation of the survey because
        of the underreporting of capital income (

        ) whereas there are no assessments about the accuracy of the labour
        income reports of evader workers. Besides, as it informs income after
        taxes, we made several assumptions to estimate gross income. The most
        important are the ones related to evasion: we assume no evasion of
        income capital and full evasion of labour income when there is not
        contribution to the social security system. The evasion assumption
        related to labour income seems no to be too unrealistic:

      - ' find that the aggregated labour income obtained under this assumption is similar to the total labour income informed by Tax Office records. However, the assumption of no evasion of income capital may be extreme and could bias the results: the highest share of income capital is observed for non-employed households (both single male and female) and one earner households (male and female breadwinner types). Future analysis should work on the underreporting and evasion of capital income and assess the sensitivity of the results to these issues.'
  - type: Paragraph

        The raw data indicate that households in which both spouses participate
        in the labour market bear the highest PIT burden followed by the typical
        patriarchal household in which the husband works in the labour market
        but not the wife. But his order changes when we control by household per
        capita income. Households supported by a working man who lives with a
        dependent housewife face the highest tax burden, followed by the
        dual-earner type. This finding is similar to the obtained for Argentina
        (

        Morocco, South Africa, Mexico and India) (

        ). When we control by different potential explanatory factors, a gap
        remains. One of the factors that explain the gap is the lower number of
        earners of male breadwinner households which is consequence of the
        individual filing design. But even in the analysis of the joint filing
        design, the PIT burden is higher for male breadwinner than dual earner
        households.

        These findings indicate that there is an incentive towards equal gender
        time allocation within the family, which is consistent with gender
        equity. On one hand, PIT does not discourage labour market participation
        of a second earner due that it is not taxed at higher rates. On the
        other hand, given that male breadwinner households may reach higher
        levels of welfare from non-taxed home production, the result is
        potentially not inconsistent with neutrality in terms of allocation
        between household and market time. However we cannot assess the
        magnitudes of the estimated PIT burden gaps. We made an exercise in
        which we compare the tax burden of a one earner couple under joint
        taxation and a two-earner couple under individual couple. We assumed
        that the three earners of the example generated the same level of labour
        income and the fourth individual, a similar value of home production.
        For different income level, we obtained that the one earner couple has a
        lower PIT burden than the two earner couple. Thus, the assessment of gap
        magnitudes appears to be a relevant topic for further research.

        Single mother households bear a lower burden than dual earner households

        However, this pattern is partly explained by non-desirable aspects: the
        higher levels of informality and participation of non-taxable sources of
        income among single female households than dual earner households.

        We also compare male and female breadwinner households, and single
        female and male households. In both comparisons we find that the male
        types bear a higher PIT burden than the female types, which is partly
        explained by the higher share of non-taxable income among female types.
        We also study three typical types of non-employed households and we do
        not find differences between female and male categories.

        Our findings may contribute to the debate of future reforms of the PIT.
        In fact, once in a while there are social pressures to reduce taxes to
        alleviate the burden on families. The question is if a new design could
        worsen horizontal equality from a gender perspective. For example, it is
        not advisable to allow exemptions for dependant spouses but it would be
        helpful to take into account persons unable to support themselves. Also
        to eliminate the option for actual joint filing would improve equality
        and, on the other sides, changes in the schedule rate of the actual
        joint filing should be carefully assessed.
