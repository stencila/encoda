            <abstract>
                <p>Bridging brain-scale circuit dynamics and organism-scale behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. It requires the concurrent development of minimal behavioral and neural circuit models that can quantitatively capture basic sensorimotor operations. Here, we focus on light-seeking navigation in zebrafish larvae. Using a virtual reality assay, we first characterize how motor and visual stimulation sequences govern the selection of discrete swim-bout events that subserve the fish navigation in the presence of a distant light source. These mechanisms are combined into a comprehensive Markov-chain model of navigation that quantitatively predicts the stationary distribution of the fish’s body orientation under any given illumination profile. We then map this behavioral description onto a neuronal model of the ARTR, a small neural circuit involved in the orientation-selection of swim bouts. We demonstrate that this visually-biased decision-making circuit can capture the statistics of both spontaneous and contrast-driven navigation.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Animal behaviors are both stereotyped and variable: they are constrained at short time scale to a finite motor repertoire while the long-term sequence of successive motor actions displays apparent stochasticity. This dual characteristic is immediately visible in the locomotion of small animals such as Nematodes (
                <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stephens et al., 2008</xref>), Zebrafish (
                <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Girdhar et al., 2015</xref>) or 
                <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (
                <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</xref>), which consists of just a few stereotyped maneuvers executed in a sequential way. In this case, behavior is best described as a set of statistical rules that defines how these elemental motor actions are chained. In the presence of sensory cues, two types of behavioral responses can be distinguished. If they signal an immediate threat or reward (e.g. the presence of a predator or a prey), they may elicit a discrete behavioral switch as the animal engages in a specialized motor program (e.g. escape or hunt, (
                <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Budick and O’Malley, 2000</xref>); (
                <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fiser et al., 2004</xref>); (
                <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>); (
                <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">McClenahan et al., 2012</xref>); (
                <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>)). However, most of the time, sensory cues merely reflect changes in external factors as the animal navigates through a complex environment. These weak motor-related cues interfere with the innate motor program to cumulatively promote the exploration of regions that are more favorable for the animal (
                <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Tsodyks et al., 1999</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fiser et al., 2004</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>A quantification of sensory-biased locomotion thus requires to first categorize the possible movements, and then to evaluate the statistical rules that relate the selection of these different actions to the sensory and motor history. Although the probabilistic nature of these rules generally precludes a deterministic prediction of the animal’s trajectory, they may still provide a quantification of the probability distribution of presence within a given environment after a given exploration time.</p>
            <p>In physics terms, the animal can thus be described as a random walker, whose transition probabilities are a function of the sensory inputs. This statistical approach was originally introduced to analyze bacteria chemotaxis (
                <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lovely and Dahlquist, 1975</xref>). Motile bacteria navigate by alternating straight swimming and turning phases, so-called runs and tumbles, resulting in trajectories akin to random walks (
                <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>). Chemotaxis originates from a chemical-driven modulation of the transition probability from run to tumble: the transition rate is governed by the time-history of chemical sensing. How this dependency is optimized to enhance gradient-climbing has been the subject of extensive literature (
                <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Macnab and Koshland, 1972</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler and Tso, 1974</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mello and Tu, 2007</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Celani and Vergassola, 2010</xref>). More recently, similar descriptions have been successfully used to quantify chemotaxis and phototaxis in multicellular organisms such as 
                <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (
                <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Ward, 1973</xref>;

                <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2008</xref>), Drosophila larva (
                <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sawin et al., 1994</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2013</xref>;

                <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Tastekin et al., 2018</xref>) or different types of slugs (
                <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Marée et al., 1999</xref>). Although the sensorimotor apparatus of these animals are very different, the taxis strategies at play appear to be convergent and can be classified based on the gradient-sensing methods (
                <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Fraenkel and Gunn, 1961</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</xref>). Tropotaxis refers to strategies in which the organism directly and instantaneously infers the stimulus direction by comparison between two spatially distinct sensory receptors. In contrast, during klinotaxis, the sensory gradient is inferred from successive samplings at different spatial positions. This second strategy is particularly adapted when the organism has only one receptor, or if the sensory gradient across the animal’s body is too small to be detected (
                <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Humberg et al., 2018</xref>). It requires at least a basic form of memory, since the sensory information needs to be retained for some finite period of time.
            </p>
            <p>In the present work, we implement such a framework to produce a comprehensive statistical model of phototaxis in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish larva is currently the only vertebrate system that allows in vivo whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution (
                <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Panier et al., 2013</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>). It thus provides a unique opportunity to study how sensorimotor tasks, such as sensory-driven locomotion, are implemented at the brain-scale level.
            </p>
            <p>Although adult zebrafish are generally photophobic (or scototactic, (
                <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Serra et al., 1999</xref>); (
                <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Maximino et al., 2007</xref>)), they display positive phototaxis at the larval stage, from 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) on (
                <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Orger and Baier, 2005</xref>). At this early stage, their locomotion consists of a series of discrete swimming events interspersed by ~1 s long periods of inactivity (
                <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Girdhar et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that, when exposed to a distant light source, the first bouts executed by the fish tend to be orientated in the direction of the source (tropotaxis) (
                <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, (
                <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Engert, 2014</xref>) have shown, using a virtual reality assay, that zebrafish are able to confine their navigation within a bright region in an otherwise dark environment even when deprived from stereovisual contrast information. This latter study thus established that their phototactic behavior also involves a spatio-temporal integration mechanism (klinotaxis).
            </p>
            <p>From a neuronal viewpoint, recent calcium imaging experiments identified a small circuit in the rostral hindbrain that plays a key role in phototaxis (
                <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; 
                <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). This region, called ARTR (anterior rhombencephalic turning region) or HBO (hindbrain oscillator), displays pseudo-periodic antiphasic oscillations, such that the activity of the left and right subpopulations alternate with a ~20 s period. This alternation was shown to set the coordinated direction of the gaze and tail bout orientation, thus effectively organizing the temporal sequence of the successive reorientations. It was further shown that this circuit oscillation could be driven by whole-field illumination of the ipsilateral eye, such as to favor the animal’s orientation towards a light source (
                <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>In the present study, we aim at quantifying the statistical rules that control the larva’s reorientation dynamics in the presence of a continuous angular gradient of illumination (orientational phototaxis). Using a virtual-reality closed-loop assay, we quantify how swim bouts selection is statistically controlled by the light intensity received on both eyes prior to the bout initiation, or the change in illumination elicited by the previous swim bout. Our experimental configuration allows us to disentangle the contribution of the two aforementioned strategies: tropotaxis and klinotaxis. From the analysis of this short-term behavior, we built a minimal Markov model of phototaxis, from which we compute the long-term distribution of orientations for any angular profile of illumination. This model offers explicit predictions of the statistics of the fish orientation that quantitatively compare with the experimental observations. We further expand on a recent rate model of the ARTR circuit to propose a functional neuronal model of spontaneous navigation and contrast-biased orientation selection. We demonstrate that the statistics of turn orientation can be fully understood by assuming that this self-oscillating circuitry, that selects the orientation of turning bouts, integrates stereovisual contrast in the form of incoming currents proportional to the visual stimulus.</p>

            <p>In this discrete Markov-chain model, time is not measured in seconds but corresponds to the number of swim bouts. It thus implicitly ignores any dependence of the transition rates with the interbout interval. We examined this hypothesis by evaluating the correlation in bouts orientations as a function of the time elapsed between them. To do so, we first sorted the turning bouts by selecting the large amplitude events (

This mechanism can be captured by assuming that the orientation selection at each bout is governed by a hidden two-state continuous-time process. The simplest one compatible with our observations is the telegraph process, whose transition probability over a small interval

            <p>In the two following sections, we use the discrete version of the Markov-chain model to represent the fish navigation, and investigate how the model parameters are modulated in the presence of a virtual distant light source. We then go back to the underlying continuous-time process when introducing a neuronal rate model for the orientation selection process.</p>

The visual stimulus consisted of two uniformly lit half-disks, each covering one visual hemifield. The intensity delivered to the left and right eyes, noted

                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig2">Figure 2H–K</ext-link>). We found that the orientational drift solely results from a probabilistic bias in the selection of the turning bouts (left 
                <italic>vs</italic> right) orientation: the mean orientation of the turning bouts varies linearly with the imposed contrast (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig2">Figure 2I</ext-link>). Reversely, the ratio of turning bouts and the variance of the two distributions are insensitive to the contrast 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig2">Figure 2J–K</ext-link>). These results indicate that the stereo-visual contrast has no impact neither on bout type selection nor on bout amplitude.
            </p>
            <p>As discussed in the preceding section, in the absence of visual cue, successive bouts tend to be oriented in the same direction. During phototaxis, the selection of the turning orientation is thus expected to reflect a competition between two distinct mechanisms: motor persistence, which favors the previous bout orientation, and stereo-visual bias, which favors the brighter side. To investigate how these two processes interfere, we sorted the bouts into two categories. In the first one, called 'reinforcement’, the bright side is in the direction of the previous bout, such that both the motor and sensory cues act in concert. In the second one, called 'conflicting’, the contrast tends to evoke a turning bout in a direction opposite to the previous one. For each category, we plotted the mean reorientation angle at bout

Noticeably, in the conflicting situation at maximum contrast, the visual cue and motor persistence almost cancel each other out such that the mean orientation is close to (

            <p>We now turn to the second paradigm, in which the stereo-visual contrast is null (both eyes receive the same illumination at any time), but the total perceived illumination is orientation-dependent (klinotaxis regime). We thus imposed a uniform illumination to the fish whose intensity

            <p>Although the efficiency of the phototactic behavior is comparable to the tropotaxis case previously examined, here we did not observe any systematic bias of the reorientation bouts towards the brighter direction (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig3">Figure 3F</ext-link>). This indicates that the larvae do not use the change in intensity at a given bout to infer the orientation of the source in order to bias the orientation of the forthcoming turn. Instead, the phototactic process originates from a visually driven modulation of the orientational diffusivity, as measured by the variance of the bout angle distributions (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig3">Figure 3G</ext-link>). The use of different profiles allowed us to identify which particular feature of the visual stimulus drives this modulation. Although the bout amplitude variance was dependent on the intensity

            <title>A biased random walk model for phototaxis provides a quantitative prediction of light-driven orientational bias</title>
            <p>In the preceding sections, we quantified how visual stimuli stochastically modulate specific kinematic parameters of the subsequent bout. We used these relationships to build a biased random walk model of phototaxis. We then tested how such a model could reproduce the statistical orientational biases toward the directions of minimal contrast and maximal illumination. The phototactic model thus incorporates a visually-driven bias to the discrete Markov-chain model introduced to represent the spontaneous navigation (

            <p>This stochastic model was tested under two conditions, tropo- and klino-phototaxis, similar to those probed in the experiments (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig4">Figure 4B</ext-link>). In order to account for the sampling bias associated with the finite size of the experimental ROI, the particles in the simulations also progressed in a 2D arena. At each time step, a forward displacement was drawn from a gamma distribution adjusted on the experimental data (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</ext-link>). Statistical analysis was restricted to bouts executed within a circular ROI as in the experimental assay.

This minimal stochastic model quantitatively captures the distribution of orientations. It also reproduces the evolution of the orientational bias with the bout index as measured by the length of the resultant vector (

            <title>A neuronal model of the ARTR captures spontaneous and contrast-driven navigation</title>
            <p>The behavioral description proposed above indicates that larvae navigation can be correctly accounted for by two independent stochastic processes: one that organizes the sequence of successive bouts amplitude and in particular the selection of forward 
                <italic>vs</italic> turning events, while a second one selects the left 
                <italic>vs</italic> right orientation of the turning bouts. These two processes are independently modulated by two distinct features of the visual stimulus, namely the global intensity changes and the stereo-visual contrast, leading to the two phototactic strategies.
            </p>
            <p>This in turn suggests that, at the neuronal level, two independent circuits may control these characteristics of the executed swim bouts. As mentioned in the introduction, the ARTR is a natural candidate for the neuronal selection of bouts orientation. This small bilaterally-distributed circuit located in the anterior hindbrain displays antiphasic activity oscillation with ~ 20s period (
                <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>). The currently active region (left or right) constitutes a strong predictor of the orientation of turning bouts (
                <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>). This circuit further integrates visual inputs as each ARTR subpopulation responds to the stimulation of the ipsilateral eye (
                <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Here, we adapted a minimal neuronal model of the ARTR, introduced in (
                <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>) to interpret the calcium recordings, and tested whether it could explain the observed statistics of exploration in both spontaneous and phototactic conditions. The architecture of the model is depicted in 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5">Figure 5A</ext-link> and the equations governing the network dynamics are provided in Appendix 2. The network consists of two modules selective for leftward and rightward turning, respectively. Recurrent excitation (

Finally, each ARTR module receives an input current from the visual system proportional to the illumination of the ipsilateral eye. Such architecture gives rise to a stimulus-selective attractor as described in (

            <p>The various model parameters were adjusted in order to match the behavioral data (see Appendix 2). First, the self-excitatory and cross-inhibitory couplings were chosen such that the circuit displayed spontaneous oscillatory dynamics in the absence of sensory input. 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5">Figure 5B</ext-link> shows example traces of the two units’ activity in this particular regime. From these two traces, we extracted a binary 'orientational state’ signal by assigning to each time point a left or right value (indicated in red and blue, respectively), based on the identity of the module with the largest activity.
            </p>
            <p>In the present approach, tail bouts are assumed to be triggered independently of the ARTR activity. The latter thus acts as mere orientational hub by selecting the orientation of the turning events: incoming bouts are oriented in the direction associated with the currently active module. In the absence of information regarding the circuit that organizes the swim bouts emission, their timing and absolute amplitude were drawn from the behavioral recordings of freely swimming larvae. Combined with the ARTR dynamics, this yielded a discrete sequence of simulated bouts (leftward, rightward and forward, 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5">Figure 5B</ext-link>, inset). With adequate choice of parameters, this model captures the orientational persistence mechanism as quantified by the slow decay of the turning bout autocorrelation with the interbout interval (

            </p>
            <p>In the presence of a lateralized visual stimulus, the oscillatory dynamics become biased towards the brighter direction (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5">Figure 5D–E</ext-link>). Hence, illuminating the right eye favors longer periods of activation of the rightward-selective ARTR unit. The mean reorientation displays a quasi-linear dependence with the imposed contrast (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5">Figure 5D</ext-link>) consistent with the behavioral observations (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig2">Figure 2G</ext-link>). At intermediate contrast values, the orientation of bouts remains stochastic; the effect of the contrast is to lengthen streaks of turning bouts toward the light (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5">Figure 5E</ext-link>). We also tested whether this model could capture the competition mechanism between stereovisual bias and motor persistence, in both conflicting and reinforcement conditions.

After a few bouts, a stationary distribution of orientation was reached that was biased toward the virtual light source (

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>Sensorimotor transformation can be viewed as an operation of massive dimensionality reduction, in which a continuous stream of sensory and motor-related signals is converted into a discrete series of stereotyped motor actions. The challenge in understanding this process is (i) to correctly categorize the motor events, that is to reveal the correct parametrization of the motor repertoire, and (ii) to unveil the statistical rules for action selection. Testing the validity of such description can be done by building a minimal model based on these rules. If the model is correct, the motor variability unaccounted for by the model should be entirely random, that is independent of the sensorimotor history.</p>
            <p>Here, we implemented a minimal model approach in order to unveil the basic rules underlying phototaxis. We showed that zebrafish light-driven orientational navigation can be quantitatively described by a stochastic model consisting of two independent Markov chains: one that selects forward scoots vs turning bouts and a second one that sets the orientation of the latter. We established that the stereo-visual contrast and global intensity modulation act separately on each of these selection processes. The contrast induces a directed bias of turning bouts toward the illuminated side, but does not impact the prevalence of turning bouts vs forward scoots. Reversely, a global decrement in illumination increases the ratio of turning bouts but does not favor any particular direction. For the contrast-driven configuration (tropotaxis), the minimal model corresponds to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (
                <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Uhlenbeck and Ornstein, 1930</xref>), which describes the dynamics of a diffusive brownian particle in a quadratic trap. In the klinotaxis configuration (in the absence of stereo-visual contrast), the orientational bias solely results from a light-dependent modulation of the diffusivity, a mechanism reminiscent of bacterial chemotaxis.
            </p>
            <p>This stochastic minimal model is built on a simple decision tree (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig4">Figure 4A</ext-link>) with a set of binary choices. However, to fully capture the orientational dynamics, we had to incorporate the continuous increase in turning bout amplitude with the light decrement in an ad-hoc way. It is currently unclear whether all turn bouts in our experiments can be assigned to a single class of swim maneuvers that are modulated in amplitude, or whether these encompass distinct motor programs executed with varying frequencies. In the latter case, it might be possible to represent this amplitude modulation through an extension of the decision tree that would select between distinct turn bout categories.
            </p>
            <p>Compared to previous studies on phototaxis, for example (
                <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>), our approach allowed us to clearly disentangle the contributions of spatial (stereovisual contrast) and time-dependent (motion-induced change in global illumination) visual cues. Hence, the contrast-driven assays were performed under constant overall illumination intensity (the sum of left and right intensities). This allowed us to establish that, rather surprisingly, the probability of triggering a turn (vs a forward swim) is insensitive to the imposed contrast. This possibility constitutes an important asset with respect to standard experimental configurations, such as the one examined by (
                <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>), in which the animal is submitted to an actual light source. Although these configurations provide a more realistic context, the visual stimulus effectively perceived by each eye can not be quantitatively assessed, which precludes the design of predictive models. Conversely, once adjusted on well-controlled virtual assays, our model could be numerically implemented in realistic environments, and the trajectories could then be directly confronted with behavioral data. This would require to first infer how the intensity impinging on each eye depends on the source distance and orientation relative to the animal body axis.
            </p>
            <p>Another critical and distinct aspect of the present work is its focus on the steady-state dynamics. Our aim was to mimic the continuous exploration of an environment in which the brightness level displayed slowly varying angular modulations. The luminosity profiles were thus chosen to ensure that individual bouts elicited relatively mild changes in illumination. By doing so, we tried to mitigate visual startle responses that are known to be elicited upon sudden darkening (
                <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Easter and Nicola, 1996</xref>). Although we could not avoid the initial large drop in illumination at the onset of each trial, the associated short-term response (i.e. the first bout) was excluded from the analysis. In this respect, our experiment differs from the study of (
                <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Engert, 2014</xref>) in which a similar closed-loop setup was used to demonstrate the ability of larvae to confine their navigation within bright regions. This behavior was entirely controlled by the animal’s response to light-on or light-off stimuli as it crossed the virtual border between a bright central disk and the dark outer area. These sharp transitions resulted in clear-cut behavioral changes that lasted for a few bouts. In comparison, our experiment addresses a different regime in which subtle light-driven biases in the spontaneous exploration cumulatively drive the animal toward brightest regions.
            </p>
            <p>As we aimed to obtain a simple and tractable kinematic description, we ignored some other aspects of the navigation characteristics. First, we focused on the orientation of the animal and thus did not systematically investigate how the forward components of the swim bouts were impacted by visual stimuli. However, in the context of angle-dependent intensity profiles, this effect should not impact the observed orientational dynamics. More importantly, we ran most of our analysis using the bout number as a time-scale, and thus ignored possible light-driven modulations of the inter-bout intervals (

In particular, we expect that changes in bout frequency, reflecting various levels of motor activity, may significantly affect the geometry of the trajectories (and not only the speed at which they are explored). We illustrated this process by running numerical experiments at similar flipping rate

                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="#fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</ext-link>, exhibit increasing complexity as measured by the fractal dimension. This mechanism may explain the changes in trajectories’ geometry observed by (

            <p>An important outcome of this study is to show that light-seeking navigation uses visual cues over relatively short time scales. The bouts statistics could be captured with a first-order autoregressive process, indicating that the stimulus perceived over one

However, one should be aware that such observation is only valid provided that the sensory context remains relatively stable. Hence for instance, a prolonged uniform drop in luminosity is known to enhance the overall motor activity (generally estimated by the average displacement over a period of time) for up to several tens of minutes (

                <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Horstick et al., 2017</xref>) and thus constitutes a distinct mechanism. One particularly exciting prospect will be to understand how such behavioral plasticity may not only modulate the spontaneous activity (
                <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>) but also affects the phototactic dynamics.

            <p>One of the motivations of minimal behavioral models is to facilitate the functional identification and modeling of neural circuits that implement the identified sensorimotor operations in the brain. Here, we used the behavioral results to propose a neuronal model of the ARTR that quantitatively reproduces non-trivial aspects of the bout selection process. This recurrent neural circuit is a simplified version of working memory models developed by (

                <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>). In this class of models, the binary decision process reflects the competition between two cross-inhibitory neural populations. The circuit is endowed with two major functional capacities: (1) it can maintain mnemonic persistent activity over long periods of time, thanks to recurrent excitatory inputs; (2) it can integrate sensory signals in a graded fashion to continuously bias the statistics of the decision. This model thus naturally recapitulates the major functional features of the sensory-biased Markov side-chain - motor persistence and contrast-driven continuous bias - that organizes the orientation selection.

            <p>It is tempting to generalize about this behavior-to-circuit approach, at least in small animals such as Zebrafish or 
                <italic>Drosophila</italic>, by representing any behavior as a coordinated sequence of competing elemental actions biased by sensory feedback and organized within a hierarchical decision tree. The identification of such decision trees through quantitative behavioral analysis may provide a blueprint of the brain functional organization and significantly ease the development of circuit models of brain-scale sensorimotor computation.

            <p>All experiments were performed on wild-type Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) larvae aged 5 to 8 days post-fertilization. Larvae were reared in Petri dishes in E3 solution on a 14/10 hr light/dark cycle at 28°C, and were fed powdered nursery food every day from 6 dpf.</p>
            <p>Experiments were conducted during daytime hours (10 am to 6 pm). The arena consisted of a 14 cm in diameter Petri dish containing E3 medium. It was placed on a screen illuminated from below by a projector (ASUS S1). Infrared illumination was provided by LEDs to enable video-monitoring and subsequent tracking of the fish. We used an IR-sensitive Flea3 USB3 camera (FL3-U3-13Y13M-C, Point Grey Research, Richmond, BC, Canada) with an adjustable macro lens (Zoom 7000, Navitar, USA) equipped with an IR filter. The experimental setup was enclosed in a light-tight rig, which was maintained at 26°C using 'The Cube’ (Life Imaging Services).</p>
            <p>For the stereovisual paradigm 
                <italic>N</italic> = 47 larvae were tested, and 
                <italic>N</italic> = 37 for the temporal paradigm [(uniform 1) : 12, (uniform 2) : 11, (uniform 3) : 14]. All fish (
                <italic>N</italic>=75) that navigated in the ROI for a significant period of time during the habituation period were also used to assess spontaneous navigation statistics.

Positions and orientations (heading direction) of the fish, as well as bouts characteristics, were extracted online and the illumination pattern was updated accordingly, with a maximum latency of 34 ms. Heading direction was extracted with an accuracy of + /- 0.05 rad (

When outside the ROI, the fish was actively brought back into the ROI through the opto-motor reflex (OMR), using a concentrically moving circular pattern. One second after the fish re-entered the ROI, a new recording sequence was started.

            <p>When representing the mean of one variable against another, bin edges were chosen such that each bin would encompass the same number of data points. Circular statistics analyses (mean, variance, uniformity) and circular statistics tests, namely the circular V-test of non-uniformity of data and the one-sample test for the mean angle of a circular distribution (tested on the orientation of the light virtual light source) were performed using CircStat toolbox for Matlab (
