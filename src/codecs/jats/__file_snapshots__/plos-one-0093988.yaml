        Social dilemmas embody the tension between individual self-interest and
        the common good that is inherent in many important situations in the
        real world. In a social dilemma, individually reasonable behavior
        results in a situation in which all individuals are less well off than
        they could otherwise have been

        . From a more formal point of view, a social dilemma can be modeled as a
        game in which there exists at least one Hicks inefficient Nash
        equilibrium. It is Hicks inefficient (i.e. socially inefficient) in that
        there is at least one other outcome in which all individuals would be
        better off, and since it is a Nash equilibrium there is no incentive for
        any individual to change their behavior

        These games challenge the notion that the rational solution to a game,
        as embodied in the concept of the Nash equilibrium, accurately describes
        the behavior of humans engaged in these social dilemmas. In the TD game
        there exists a unique, pure strategy, Nash equilibrium that is
        undesirable for all concerned. In contrast to the TD game, in the MEC
        game every pure strategy is a Nash equilibrium, and thus the rational
        solution concept lacks any prescriptive or predictive power.

        The TD game is conventionally introduced through a story of the
        following form. Two travelers, on their return journey from an exotic
        country, find that their luggage containing identical souvenirs has been
        lost by the airline. The officer in the claims department puts them in
        separate rooms, hands each of them a claims form, and tells them that
        they can claim any integer amount between 
      - ' and '
      - ' ('
      - ' and '
      - ' are assumed to be positive integers with '
      - >-
        ). He also informs them that if they both ask for the same amount, they
        will be paid that amount, and if they ask for different amounts, each
        will be reimbursed at the lower value, but with a penalty 
      - ' deducted from the higher claimant (who is assumed to have lied) and given to the lower claimant (as a reward for being honest). Thus, the TD game is a 2-person game with the discrete strategy set '
      - ', and payoff to an '
      - '-claimant against a '
      - '-claimant is defined by '
      - (1)
      - >-
        In this context a Nash equilibrium is a pair of claims, such that, if
        each claim is known to the other traveler then neither has reason to
        revise their claim. For 
      - >-
        , there is an incentive for each traveler to undercut any common claim.
        Using backward induction, it is not hard to see that the travelers
        should each claim the amount 
      - ', i.e., '
      - ' is a unique Nash equilibrium for the TD game. Thus, the unique Nash equilibrium of the TD game is the paradoxical outcome in which both travelers claim the lowest possible amount. We note, in particular, that the Nash equilibrium is independent of the reward/punishment parameter '
      - >-
        . However, as intuition would suggest, this is not how individuals
        actually play this game

Moreover, standard refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept do not select a subset of the equilibria. For instance, the Nash equilibria are strict, and thus trembling hand-perfect. Hence, classical game theory provides no obvious criterion to choose among them.'

        The paradoxical results obtained for the TD and MEC games using
        classical game theory are not resolved by instead using standard
        deterministic evolutionary game theory. Since the unique Nash

        . Hence, the replicator dynamics of the TD game will always converge to
        the minimum claim level 
      - >-
        . Similarly, in the MEC game every common effort level is a strict Nash
        equilibrium and hence a stable equilibrium point for the replicator
        equations. Thus, the behavior of the replicator dynamics does not select
        any subset of the Nash equilibria. The paradoxical nature of both games
        is, therefore, equally evident when studied using either classical game
        theory or deterministic evolutionary game theory.

        It is noteworthy that the importance of the TD game and the MEC game are
        rather similar in nature. The TD game is theoretically significant
        because it exposes so clearly an apparently paradoxical aspect of game
        theory: namely the inability of the Nash equilibrium concept to predict
        the actual behavior of individuals interacting in this type of game.

        As an example of how MEC games naturally arise let us consider two
        companies, denoted by A and B, each of which manufacture a critical
        component of a jointly produced product. Let us suppose that company A
        makes widgets, while company B makes grommets. The final product,
        containing both a widget and a grommet, is sold jointly, with the
        revenues being equally split between the two companies. Each company can
        choose the amount of effort to expend in producing its component, with
        higher effort levels resulting in components of higher quality. We shall
        assume that the performance of the final product, and thus also the
        revenues obtained from sales of the product, is limited by whichever of
        the two components has the lower quality. Therefore, the profits
        obtained by a given company from sales of the product may be expressed
        as the minimum of the efforts expended by each company to produce
        widgets or grommets, respectively, minus the cost associated with the
        companies' own effort. Thus, such a situation can be modeled by a MEC
        game.

        The importance of the TD and MEC games, both theoretically and in
        practice, is clear from the above comments. Therefore, obtaining a
        satisfactory understanding of the dynamics of these games is of
        considerable significance, and it is the purpose of this paper to

        Here we propose an alternative, considerably simpler, theoretical
        framework to explain the evolutionary dynamics of both the TD and MEC
        games, which accounts for the empirically observed behavior. Our method
        applies to a wide class of games that includes both the TD and MEC
        games. We first observe that while the TD and MEC games were originally
        formulated as discrete strategy games it is natural to consider variants
        of these games in which the strategies are continuously variable. In
        this paper we define these continuous-strategy variants of the TD and
        MEC games, which suffer from the same paradoxical behavior as the
        original discrete-strategy games, and it is these continuous-strategy
        games that form the starting point for our approach to understanding the
        evolutionary dynamics of the TD and MEC games.

        dynamics for the class of games that we are considering. Since the

In this case, the evolutionary dynamics is governed by a stochastic process, and the theory is mathematically well-developed. However, there are certain restrictions that apply to the theory. Perhaps the most important is that analytic results can only be obtained in the limit that the selection strength tends to zero. This limit corresponds to the assumption that the contribution to the total payoff that comes from the game interactions is very small. It is not clear that this assumption is realistic when it comes to understanding the behavior of the TD and MEC games. If the assumption of weak selection is not made then it is impossible to obtain analytic results, although numerical simulations can yield results for stronger selection strengths. It is also worth noting that while the stochastic process underlying stochastic evolutionary dynamics is mathematically well-developed, it is rather subtle, and this can present a challenge when applying the method to new problems. In fact, stochastic evolutionary dynamics has not yet been applied to study the MEC game, although we conjecture that such an application will yield results consistent with the behavior observed in the game.'

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the Models section, we
        define continuous-strategy versions of the TD and MEC games, and also
        introduce the key notion of smoothed versions of these games. In the
        Analysis section, we analyze the evolution of strategies in the smoothed
        games in randomly-interacting populations using adaptive dynamics, and
        in addition formulate an agent-based model of the evolutionary dynamics
        of these games in populations with structures described by an arbitrary
        graph (i.e., network). In the Results section, we present the results of
        simulations using this agent-based model for the evolutionary dynamics
        of the smoothed TD and MEC games, both in well-mixed populations and in
        populations described by complex networks. Finally, in Discussion
        section, we provide a brief discussion of our work and draw some
        conclusions.

        The strategies in the TD and the MEC games are the claim levels and the
        effort levels, respectively. Typically these games are taken to have a
        discrete set of strategies. However, it is in many ways more natural to
        view the claim levels and effort levels in the two games as being
        continuously variable, and thus to consider variants of these games
        defined for continuous strategies. The continuous forms of the TD and
        MEC games are examples of a broad class of continuous-strategy 2-person
        games with payoff functions given by

      - 'for affine functions '

        Games of this form have discontinuous payoff functions. Such a
        discontinuous payoff function is only possible in an idealized world
        free from all errors. In reality, errors in the perception and
        implementation of actions in the game will have the effect of replacing
        the discontinuous payoff function with a smoothed approximation,
        representing the expected payoff. We now define such a variant of the
        game in which the discontinuity in the payoff function is removed by a
        smoothing procedure. To accomplish this we introduce a 
      - '-parameter family of smoothing functions '
      - '. The functions '
      - ' are assumed to be smooth, non-decreasing functions of '

        We next turn to the MEC game where the payoff function is given by (14).
        Consider a monomorphic population of

      - ' amount of effort. It follows from (2) and (13) that for the MEC game '

      - '. Thus, the selection gradient '
      - ' is given by '

      - (21)
      - 'Again, since '
      - ' does not depend on '
      - >-
        , there are no singular strategies. Also, rather remarkably, the
        adaptive dynamics of 
      - ' is independent of the smoothing function '
      - '. The evolution of an initial strategy '
      - ' is once again determined by the sign of '
      - '. If '
      - ' (i.e., if '
      - ') then '
      - ' will evolve to '
      - ', and if '
      - ' (i.e., if '
      - ') then '
      - ' will evolve to '
      - >-
        . Therefore, this adaptive dynamics analysis implies that the players'
        strategies in the smoothed MEC game will evolve to low efforts if the
        effort cost 
      - ' is greater than '
      - ', and to high efforts if '

        In this work we have proposed simple and natural continuous-strategy
        versions of the classical discrete-strategy TD and MEC games. We have
        modeled these games as continuous games with smooth payoff functions,
        where the smoothing accounts for the effects of errors in the perception
        and/or implementation of individuals actions. The smoothed TD and MEC
        games can be effectively analyzed using adaptive dynamics, which shows
        that the predicted evolutionary dynamics of these games is in accord
        with the behavior observed in empirical studies of the TD and MEC games.
        In addition, we have studied the evolutionary dynamics of the smoothed
        TD and MEC games using agent-based simulations. These simulations have
        been performed both for populations of randomly-interacting agents and
        for populations with more complex interaction patterns, represented by
        graphs of varying topologies. These simulation results are in agreement
        both with the analytical adaptive dynamics results, and also with the
        experimentally observed behavior.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:

        For the smoothed TD game, we find both from the adaptive dynamics
        analysis and from the agent-based simulations, that claims vary with the
        reward/punishment parameter 
      - ' in a fashion that is in excellent agreement with the empirically observed behavior: low values of '
      - ' result in high claims and high values of '
      - ' result in low claims. We recover the classical game theory result that claims in the TD game with discontinuous payoff remain low for all values of '
      - ' by considering the limit in which the smoothing parameter '
      - >-
        . Different interaction patterns among the individuals playing the
        smoothed TD game, as represented by studying the game on graphs of
        different topologies, appears to have little effect on the evolutionary
        dynamics of the game.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        We find similarly satisfactory results for the smoothed MEC game. The
        analysis, both analytical and through simulations, again yields results
        in good agreement with experiment: high effort levels are found for low
        effort cost 
      - ' and low effort levels occur for high effort cost. We again find that when the smoothed MEC game is formulated on graphs of differing topology the topological type has no significant effect on the evolutionary dynamics of the game.'

        The methods introduced in this paper are quite general and can be
        applied to a wide variety of continuous-strategy games with

      - ' one considers the interactions between two firms that produce a homogeneous product. The strategy of each firm is the unit price that they set for their product. It is assumed that customers will buy a quantity '
      - ' (where '
      - ' is the demand function) from the firm with the lower price '
      - >-
        , and will buy nothing from the firm with the higher price. If both
        firms set the same price then it is assumed that demand is split equally
        between them. It is also assumed that both firms have the same marginal
        cost 
      - >-
        . Thus, the payoff obtained by one firm in its interaction with the
        other is a discontinuous function of the difference between the prices
        set by the two firms. This discontinuous payoff function can be smoothed
        in exactly the manner described in this paper to yield a smoothed game.
        In this case the smoothing function represents the probability that
        customers buy the product from the firm with the lower price as opposed
        to the firm with the higher price. In the limit that this probability
        tends to one, the smoothed game approaches the classical game.

        The smoothed BD model can be analyzed using adaptive dynamics just as we
        have done here for the TD and MEC games. It may be shown for an
        arbitrary smoothing, that given a linear demand function 
      - ' there exists a unique singular strategy '
      - ' (in the domain of interest), that is strictly greater than the marginal cost '
      - '. Furthermore, it may also be shown that the singular strategy '
      - ' is always both convergent stable and an ESS. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of the smoothed BD game results in the prices set by both firms converging to the level '
      - >-
        , which is strictly greater than the marginal cost. At the evolutionary
        equilibrium 
      - ' both firms obtain a positive payoff. Thus, the introduction of the smoothed BD model effectively resolves the Bertrand Paradox that occurs in the classical model. Moreover, our method extends to the case of an arbitrary number of firms and sheds light on the results obtained in '

        . The classical WoA game is concerned with two individuals who are
        contesting a resource. In this game each individual chooses a ''display
        investment,'' which is a continuous variable representing the
        individual's strategy. The payoff in the classical game is a
        discontinuous function of the difference in the display investments
        since it is assumed that the individual with the higher investment
        obtains the resource, while the lower investor does not, and both pay a
        cost that is a function of the lower investment value.

        This game can be smoothed and studied using adaptive dynamics as we have
        done in this paper for the TD and MEC games. It may be shown that the
        evolutionary dynamics depends critically on the form of the cost
        function. For a linear cost function, there exists a singular strategy
        that is always both convergent stable and an ESS. However, for quadratic
        cost functions, there exist singular strategies that are evolutionary
        branching points. Thus, in the latter case, complex and surprising
        evolutionary dynamics can occur.

        In conclusion, therefore, we have introduced a new method of formulating
        and analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of a wide class of games, which
        include the continuous-strategy variants of the TD and MEC games. We
        have studied the case of the smoothed TD and MEC games in detail and
        shown that our method provides a means of resolving the paradoxical
        behavior associated with the original form of the games.
