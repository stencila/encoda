        Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the
        counter products, mostly as food supplements, to avoid the strict rules
        of medicinal products. Side-effects reported in anecdotal consumer
        reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to
        hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychoactive Δ

        -tetrahydrocannainol (THC). However, research of pure CBD solutions
        stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage
        conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid
        chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high
        pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass
        spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation.
        Another hypothesis for the side-effects of CBD products may be residual
        THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of
        them are based on crude hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of
        cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 28 food products of the German
        market containing hemp extract as an ingredient (mostly CBD oils)
        confirmed this hypothesis: 10 products (36%) contained THC above the
        lowest observed adverse effects level (2.5 mg/day). Inversely, CBD was
        present in the products below the no observed adverse effect level.
        Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD
        products are based on a low-dose effect of THC and not due to effects of
        CBD itself. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products
        is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection
        showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe THC
        levels, full-spectrum hemp extracts as non-approved novel food
        ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food
        labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle
        products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business
        operators' own responsibility for product safety must obviously be
        challenged.

        . Some product groups (e.g., cosmetics, veterinary supplements, waxes or
        room fragrances) may be produced with intended off-label use, such as
        human consumption, in mind and therefore deliberately avoiding the

        From all hemp constituents, cannabidiol (CBD) is currently the compound
        with highest interest. In contrast to THC, the major drug-constituent of
        hemp, CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid. It is currently being
        tested for its possible antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic and
        antiemetic effects as a drug, e.g. for the treatment of epilepsy

        . However, CBD products of all kinds can now also be purchased in
        organic shops, drug stores, supermarkets and via the Internet, mostly by
        advertising dubious “cure-all” properties including anti-carcinogenic
        effects or various unspecific health advantages. The marketing of CBD
        products is based on the current “hype” around medicinal hemp products,
        whereby the CBD products are offered as a supposedly safe alternative,
        promised as being free of psychoactive components or their side-effects

        Commercial CBD products are usually crude extracts from whole hemp
        plants (i.e., including flowers and stems). In other ways (e.g., in
        extracting the food-approved plant parts such as seeds), contents in the
        range of 1–10% CBD, which are typically advertised, cannot be achieved.
        Also, the limited available literature and manufacturer data confirm
        that CBD products are usually extracted by supercritical CO

        . Probably due to cost reasons, no further specific enrichment or
        cleanup of CBD is conducted, so that the commercial extracts are a
        cannabinoid mixture rather than pure CBD. These extracts are then mixed
        into ordinary edible oils such as sunflower oil, olive oil or hemp seed
        oil to obtain the so-called CBD oil

        The strategy to market CBD oil products as food supplements within the
        framework of food regulations seems to be the most common approach of
        food operators. Some other products, derived from hemp extracts, are CBD
        chewing gum, “CBD flowers” (plant material sold as tea), and cannabis
        resin, wax or pollen products.

        However, no significant food consumption of full-spectrum hemp extracts
        or hemp flowers containing CBD has been documented before 15 May 1997.
        These products are therefore classified as “novel” in the Novel Food
        catalogue of the European Commission under the entry “cannabinoids” and
        therefore require approval according to the Novel Food Regulation. Up to
        date (as of July 2019), no approved application is recorded. Basically,
        all available CBD products based on hemp extract marketed as food or
        food supplement within the EU are therefore illegally sold, but still
        widely available in all trade channels (retail, wholesale and
        e-commerce) due to an apparent lack of enforcement

        Anecdotal cases ranging from malaise to THC-like effects have become
        known to the food control authorities in consumer complaint cases
        regarding CBD products. Additionally, some pediatric studies in epilepsy
        patients with orally administered CBD also reported adverse effects such
        as drowsiness and fatigue that could be explained by pharmacological
        properties of THC rather than of CBD

        . Currently there are three hypotheses for the cause of the side
        effects: (i) a direct pharmacological effect of CBD, (ii) the
        degradation of CBD to THC due to acidic hydrolysis in the stomach
        following oral consumption, and (iii) THC directly contained in the
        products as by-product due to co-extraction and enrichment or
        contamination. In this article, the hypotheses are investigated
        including new evidence from original data.

        To investigate CBD degradation, differently concentrated CBD in
        methanolic solutions was used in a range corresponding to typical
        amounts consumed with supplements based on commercial CBD (Supelco
        Cerilliant #C-045, 1.0 mg/mL in methanol) supplied by Merck (Darmstadt,
        Germany). These solutions were exposed to an artificial gastric juice as
        well as different incubation times and stress factors such as storage
        under light and heat (see

         for full experimental design). The solutions were stored either in standard freezer (-18°C) or refrigerator (8°C) or at room temperature (20°C). Increased temperatures were achieved using a thermostatically controlled laboratory drying oven type “UT6120” (Heraeus, Langenselbold, Germany) set to either 37°C or 60°C. The daylight condition was achieved by storage at a window (south side). For ultraviolet light exposure, six 25 W ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent tubes type “excellent E” (99.1% UVA) built into a facial tanner type “NT 446 U” (Dr. Kern GmbH, Mademühlen, Germany) were placed 15 cm from the surface of the solutions.

        Baden-Württemberg, other available hemp extract products in retail, as
        well as all products available at the warehouse of a large internet
        retailer were sampled between December 2018 and July 2019. A total of 28

        There is not much evidence to assume that chemically pure CBD may
        exhibit THC-like side-effects. The World Health Organization (WHO)
        judged the compound as being well tolerated with a good safety profile

         and the CBD doses in the food supplements on the market are typically much lower than the ones tested in clinical studies. Additionally, there is a 90-day experiment in rats with a hemp extract (consisting of 26% cannabinoids, 96% CBD and <1% THC) from which a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day could be derived

        . For CBD this would be about 25 mg/kg bw/day (or 1750 mg/day for a
        person with a body weight of 70 kg). This NOAEL would not be reached by
        the CBD dosages in food supplements.

        , no conversion of CBD to THC was observed in any of the samples. Only
        in case of the positive control (2 week storage in 0.5 mol/L HCl and 50%
        methanol), a complete degradation of CBD into 27% THC and other not
        identified products (with fragments similar to the ones found in CBN and
        THC fragmentations but with other retention times) was observed (

        ). From an analytical viewpoint, the use of less selective and specific
        analytical methods, especially from the point of chromatographic
        separation, could result in a situation in which certain CBD degradation
        products might easily be confused with THC due to structural
        similarities. Thus, similar fragmentation patterns and potentially
        overlapping peaks under certain chromatographic conditions might have
        led to false positive results in the previous studies. In conclusion of
        our degradation experiments, we agree with more recent literature

        Some of the CBD oil supplements contained THC in doses up to 30 mg,
        which can easily explain the adverse effects observed by some consumers.
        Most of the CBD oils with dosage of around 1 mg offer the possibility to
        achieve intoxicating dosages of THC if the products are used off-label
        (i.e. increase of the labelled maximal dosage by factors of 3–5, which
        is probably not an unlikely scenario). Generally, in the current purity,
        the CBD products achieve an insufficient margin of safety, especially in
        light of the German guidance value for THC in food products

        Hence our results provide compelling evidence that THC natively
        contained in CBD products by contamination may be a direct cause for
        side effects of these products. Obviously, there is an involuntary or
        deliberate lack of quality control of CBD products. Claims of
        “THC-free”, used by most manufacturers, even of the highly contaminated
        products, have to be treated as fraudulent or deceptive food
        information.

        In light of the discussion about the three potential causative factors
        for side effects of CBD products, the described effects can be explained
        most probably by the presence of native THC as contaminant in the
        products rather than by direct action of CBD or its chemical
        transformation or metabolization. The conclusions and findings of this
        study are further supported by the findings of Hazekamp

        CBD degradation products are currently unknown and need to be
        characterized and toxicologically assessed, e.g. within the context of
        the novel food registration process. Until then, the safety of the
        products remains questionable. Furthermore, standardization and
        purification of the extracts need to be improved and stability of
        commercial products during shelf life should be checked (e.g. to prevent
        CBD degradation by avoiding acidity in ingredients etc.). Finally, the
        production hygiene also needs to be improved to minimize contamination.
        According to own observations some CBD oils are manufactured in back
        offices not suitable for food production.

        In our opinion the high THC content of CBD products is almost a “small
        scandal” on the food market. Obviously, the manufacturers have -
        deliberately or in complete ignorance of the legal situation - placed
        unsafe and unapproved products on the market and thus exposed the
        consumer to an actually avoidable risk. In view of the growing market
        for such lifestyle food supplements, the effectiveness of the instrument
        of food business operators’ own responsibility for food safety must
        obviously be challenged.
