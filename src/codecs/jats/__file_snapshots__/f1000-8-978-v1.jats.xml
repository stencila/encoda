Many of the important United Arab Emirates (UAE) plant species, for instance, may be facing major challenges for their survival.

In addition to the natural prolonged drought, human activities are also threatening many native plants

This species is known for delayed seed germination, which is due to the hard coat of its seeds, therefore lowering its ability to compete with other plants over resources. This tree has different importance to people and animals. The honey produced from its flowers is very valuable and its leaves has various medicinal uses. The leaves also contain various flavonoids, saponin, alkaloids, and allelochemicals.

            <p>All three species’ presence-only data was used and each species had 100 georeferenced location data. For the selected species, the model was trained using current bioclimatic data and projected using future bioclimatic variables. To visualize the bioclimatic suitability range shift in the future projection, this study has used clamping module while running the model. Final outputs of the model predictions were exported to ArcGIS 10.1 for further analysis. The exported model outputs were converted to raster files and then the predicted habitat suitability ranges were reclassified using three pre-defined probability classes: high, medium and low. Other model settings were kept unmodified and the Jackknife method was used to assess the variable contribution to the habitat distribution. Model fit was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) values.</p>

                <italic>Ziziphus spina-christi</italic> had comparatively high present suitable habitat in the country. All three species were projected to have an increased level of high habitat suitability in the future.

This might be the reason for larger area distribution of this species in the UAE. Yet these species’ future habitat suitability areas are important for the country to incorporate in the conservation strategies under climate change. The areas predicted to be suitable can be considered for afforestation programs in the UAE. For all the three species, and with climate change impact, maximum habitat suitability predictions will be in the north-eastern parts of the UAE. It is important to highlight that one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change are dry land ecosystems

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>The MaxEnt model provides useful information about species and their satiable habitats, which can be used as a basis in planning future conservation and afforestation programs. Additionally, the model is also efficient in predicting species distribution under different climate change scenarios. Conservation and afforestation programs considering the species and their suitable habitats, therefore, will not only be easily manageable and sustainable but also economically efficient by using different SDMs. Finer spatial scales of species distribution modeling may be an appropriate next step toward species conservation under the potential changes in climatic conditions.</p>
