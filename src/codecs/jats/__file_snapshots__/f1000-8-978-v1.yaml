      - >-
        The impact of climate change on selected plant species from the
        hyper-arid landscape of United Arab Emirates (UAE) was assessed through
        modeling of their habitat suitability and distribution.

        The adopted method consists of extraction of current and future
        bioclimatic variables together with their land use cover and elevation
        for the study area. MaxEnt species distribution model was then used to
        simulate the distribution of the selected species. The projections are
        simulated for the current date, the 2050s and 2070s using Community
        Climate System Model version 4 with representative concentration pathway
        RCP4.5.

         suggests that dry-land regions are projected to significant climate changes, but there still exist substantial variability and uncertainty in these estimates based on different scenarios. Many of the important United Arab Emirates (UAE) plant species, for instance, may be facing major challenges for their survival. Many of such native species are becoming restricted in their distributions because of overgrazing and habitat destruction. In addition to the natural prolonged drought, human activities are also threatening many native plants

         can resist heat and drought and its deep taproot provide an extraordinary regenerative potentials. This might be the reason for larger area distribution of this species in the UAE. Yet these species’ future habitat suitability areas are important for the country to incorporate in the conservation strategies under climate change. The areas predicted to be suitable can be considered for afforestation programs in the UAE. For all the three species, and with climate change impact, maximum habitat suitability predictions will be in the north-eastern parts of the UAE. It is important to highlight that one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change are dry land ecosystems

        The MaxEnt model provides useful information about species and their
        satiable habitats, which can be used as a basis in planning future
        conservation and afforestation programs. Additionally, the model is also
        efficient in predicting species distribution under different climate
        change scenarios. Conservation and afforestation programs considering
        the species and their suitable habitats, therefore, will not only be
        easily manageable and sustainable but also economically efficient by
        using different SDMs. Finer spatial scales of species distribution
        modeling may be an appropriate next step toward species conservation
        under the potential changes in climatic conditions.
