    , we published a Registered Report (Blum et al., 2015), that described how
    we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper
    ‘Transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated c-Myc’ (Lin et
    al., 2012). Here we report the results. We found overexpression of c-Myc
    increased total levels of RNA in P493-6 Burkitt’s lymphoma cells; however,
    while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 3E;
    Lin et al., 2012), statistical significance and the size of the effect
    varied between the original study and the two different lots of serum tested
    in this replication. Digital gene expression analysis for a set of genes was
    also performed on P493-6 cells before and after c-Myc overexpression.
    Transcripts from genes that were active before c-Myc induction increased in
    expression following c-Myc overexpression, similar to the original study
    (Figure 3F; Lin et al., 2012). Transcripts from genes that were silent
    before c-Myc induction also increased in expression following c-Myc
    overexpression, while the original study concluded elevated c-Myc had no
    effect on silent genes (Figure 3F; Lin et al., 2012). Treating the data as
    paired, we found a statistically significant increase in gene expression for
    both active and silent genes upon c-Myc induction, with the change in gene
    expression greater for active genes compared to silent genes. Finally, we
    report meta-analyses for each result.

        . We quantified mRNA levels/cell of 1369 genes, of which 1212 were the
        same genes as the 1338 genes interrogated in the original study. We used
        the same criteria as the original study to classify a gene as silent
        (expression was less than 0.5 transcript/cell at time 0 hr) or active
        (more than one transcript/cell at time 0 hr). In cells with low levels
        of c-Myc (0 hr) there were 708 active genes with a median expression of
        4.70, and 580 silent genes with a median expression of 0.032, for serum
        lot one. For active genes, 75% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr,
        68% increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 59% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr
        upon c-Myc induction. This corresponds to a 1.11, 1.50, and 1.36 times
        increase in median expression, respectively (

        ). For silent genes, 74% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr, 66%
        increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 50% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr,
        corresponding to a 1.19 and 1.13 times increase, and a 0.05 times

        ). This compares to the original study that identified 755 active genes
        with a median expression of 7.06, and 514 silent genes with a median
        expression of 0.00 (more than half the silent genes did not have a
        reported expression value). Active genes in the original study,
        increased 91% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 96% from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 87% from 1
        hr to 24 hr upon c-Myc induction, corresponding to a 1.23, 2.45, and
        1.99 times increase in median expression, respectively. Silent genes in
        the original study, increased 23% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 29% from 0 hr to 24
        hr, and 30% from 1 hr to 24 hr, with the median expression unchanged
        among conditions. In addition, we further examined the extent of overlap
        of active and silent genes between the original study and this
        replication attempt. Of the 1212 genes that were interrogated in both
        studies, 88.8% (603/679) of the active genes we identified in serum lot
        one were also active in the original study (90.1% (612/679) for serum
        lot two). For silent genes, 96.4% (456/473) of the genes we identified
        as silent in serum lot one were common with the silent genes identified
        in the original study (95.8% (453/473) for serum lot two).

        the test reported in the original study, we conducted these paired

        . To test whether active genes increased in expression during c-Myc
        induction more than silent genes, we performed an exploratory analysis
        on the difference in expression of active genes during c-Myc induction
        (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr) compared to the difference in expression of
        silent genes over that same period (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr). For both
        the original and replication data, there was a statistically significant
        increase in expression of active genes compared to silent genes (

        ). This suggests that active genes and silent genes do not have similar
        rates of expression upon c-Myc induction. To summarize, for this
        experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the
        original study and suggest that while both active and silent genes
        increased in expression upon c-Myc induction, the rate of increase was
        different.

        nCounter GX Human Kinase Kit, nCounter Custom CodeSet) encompassing 1369
        genes across multiple functional categories were used. Following
        hybridization, samples were immediately processed with the nCounter
        Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, NCT-PREP-120). The count data
        was collected using the nCounter RCC Collector Worksheet (NanoString

        housekeeping gene-normalized per nCounter guidelines. Expression for
        each gene was averaged across the four independent replicate samples.
        Additionally, for genes that appeared on multiple CodeSets, expression
        values were averaged together to generate a single value for each gene.
        A gene was defined as transcriptionally active if its average expression
        was above one transcript/cell at 0 hr and transcriptionally silent if
        below 0.5 transcript/cell. A list of all Reporter CodeSets and their

The proposed statistical analysis for the western blot analysis (Protocol 1) described in the Registered Report was not performed since the levels of normalized c-Myc at time 0 hr was at the limit of detection. The number of genes analyzed in the original study, and thus listed in the Registered Report, was reported incorrectly as 1388 instead of 1338 (data shared by original authors). NanoString analysis was conducted using the nCounter RCC Collector Worksheet instead of nSolver Analysis software. Additionally, the statistical tests reported in\_Figure\_3F of the original study incorrectly described the comparisons as between 0 hr and 1 hr instead of between 0 hr and 24 hr (scripts shared by original authors).
