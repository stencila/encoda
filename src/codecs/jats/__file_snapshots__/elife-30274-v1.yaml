      - 'The '
      - 'Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology'
      - ' (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the '
      - Center for Open Science
      - ' and '
      - Science Exchange
      - ' that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology ('
      - 'Errington et al., 2014'
      - >-
        ). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed
        experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer
        reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a
        Replication Study that reports the results of the replication
        experiments detailed in the Registered Report (
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'
      - >-
        ) for a 2012 paper by Lin et al., and uses a number of approaches to
        compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.
  - type: Paragraph

      - >-
        In 2012, Lin et al. reported results that the c-Myc transcription
        factor, a potent oncogene that is frequently overexpressed in a large
        percentage of cancers, globally amplifies the expression of actively
        transcribed genes, opposed to regulating specific target genes. Using
        the P493-6 cell line, a model for 
      - MYC
      - ' activation in Burkitt’s lymphoma, total levels of RNA per cell were reported to increase when c-Myc was highly expressed compared to conditions where c-Myc expression was low. Additionally, active genes in cells with low c-Myc levels were reported to increase in expression upon c-Myc induction, in contrast to genes that were silent under low c-Myc conditions that did not change.'
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - "The Registered Report for the 2012 paper by Lin et al. described the experiments to be replicated\_(Figure\_1B and 3E–F), and summarized the current evidence for these findings ("
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'
      - >-
        ). Since that publication there have been additional studies
        investigating the ability c-Myc to influence the global gene expression
        output of cells. Similar to Lin et al. other studies have reported c-Myc
        dependent amplification of cellular RNA (
      - 'Hart et al., 20152014'
      - '; '
      - 'Hsu et al., 2015'
      - '; '
      - 'Nie et al., 2012'
      - '; '
      - 'Sabò et al., 2014'
      - >-
        ), although this observation was not reported in all biological systems
        (
      - 'Fagnocchi et al., 2016'
      - '; '
      - 'Sabò et al., 2014'
      - '; '
      - 'Walz et al., 2014'
      - >-
        ). It has been suggested c-Myc regulates specific genes that indirectly
        lead to RNA amplification (
      - 'Sabò et al., 2014'
      - '; '
      - 'Sabò and Amati, 2014'
      - '; '
      - 'Walz et al., 2014'
      - ). This has also been suggested of MYCN (
      - 'Duffy et al., 20142015'
      - >-
        ). The reported differences could be a result of the intrinsic variation
        between cell lines in maintaining the transcriptome (
      - 'Trakhtenberg et al., 2016'
      - >-
        ). Indeed, a recent study reported that distinct transcriptional
        regulation can be accounted for by differences in promoter affinity
        under different c-Myc expression levels (
      - 'Lorenzin et al., 2016'
      - ).

        The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be
        aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a
        dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility
        of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence
        reproducibility more generally.

        To test the effects of increased levels of c-Myc on gene expression we
        used the same human P493-6 B cell line of Burkitt’s lymphoma that
        contains a conditional tetracycline-repressive

        ) as the original study. We performed Western blot analysis to confirm
        c-Myc expression could be reduced to very low levels and then
        reactivated after removal of tetracycline. This is comparable to what
        was reported in Figure 1B of 
      - Lin et al. (2012)
      - ' and described in Protocol 1 in the Registered Report ('
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'

        ). Since proliferation of P493-6 cells depend on c-Myc expression and
        the presence of serum (

      - '; '
      - 'Schuhmacher et al., 1999'

        ), with serum reported to stimulate a majority of genes independent of
        c-Myc (
      - 'Schlosser et al., 2005'
      - "), we maintained these cells in separate lots of serum to assess whether the results differed. For cells maintained in both lots of serum, treatment with tetracycline resulted in a strong decrease in c-Myc protein levels\_("
      - Figure 1A
      - >-
        ). After removal of tetracycline, c-Myc levels increased over time
        approaching the levels observed in tetracycline-free conditions.

        We sought to independently replicate whether increased levels of c-Myc
        resulted in increased absolute levels of RNA. This experiment is similar
        to what was reported in Figure 3E of 
      - Lin et al. (2012)

        ). Total RNA was isolated from P493-6 cells 0, 1, and 24 hr after
        tetracycline release and the amount of RNA per 1,000 cells was
        quantified (
      - Figure 1B
      - "). We found that under conditions where c-Myc expression was low (0 hr), there was a mean of 1.55 ng total RNA per 1,000 cells (ng/1 k cells) [n\_=\_3, "

        =0.0024). This compares to the original study, which reported a mean of
        4.25 ng/1 k cells at 0 hr, which increased to 5.47 ng/1 k cells at 24
        hr, a 1.29 times increase in total RNA levels. In both studies there was
        a minor decrease at 1 hr after tetracycline release when c-Myc levels
        begin to become detectable. Total RNA per 1,000 cells at 0 hr were much
        lower in this replication attempt than those reported in the original
        study, although changes in total RNA levels were in the same direction
        following c-Myc expression. Similarly, another independent study that
        measured total RNA from P493-6 cells reported a different level at 0 hr
        (~3 ng/1 k cells), while also reporting increased levels following c-Myc
        expression (
      - 'Sabò et al., 2014'
      - >-
        ). There are multiple possible explanations for these differences, such
        as variation in RNA expression during cell culture passage (
      - 'Hiorns et al., 2004'
      - >-
        ), low yield of the RNA isolation procedure (e.g. incomplete
        homogenization), or the high variance associated with manual cell counts
        using a hemacytometer (
      - 'Biggs and Macmillan, 1948'
      - '; '
      - 'Nielson et al., 1991'
      - >-
        ). To summarize, for this experiment we found results that were in the
        same direction as the original study and not statistically significant
        for serum lot one, while statistically significant for serum lot two.

      - "To test whether c-Myc expression amplifies the existing gene expression program, digital gene expression analysis using the NanoString nCounter platform was performed on a set of genes from multiple functional categories.

      - ' and described in Protocols 3–4 in the Registered Report ('
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'
      - >-
        ). We quantified mRNA levels/cell of 1369 genes, of which 1212 were the
        same genes as the 1338 genes interrogated in the original study. We used
        the same criteria as the original study to classify a gene as silent
        (expression was less than 0.5 transcript/cell at time 0 hr) or active
        (more than one transcript/cell at time 0 hr). In cells with low levels
        of c-Myc (0 hr) there were 708 active genes with a median expression of
        4.70, and 580 silent genes with a median expression of 0.032, for serum
        lot one. For active genes, 75% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr,
        68% increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 59% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr
        upon c-Myc induction. This corresponds to a 1.11, 1.50, and 1.36 times
        increase in median expression, respectively (
      - Figure 2
      - ', '
      - Figure 2—figure supplement 1
      - >-
        ). For silent genes, 74% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr, 66%
        increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 50% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr,
        corresponding to a 1.19 and 1.13 times increase, and a 0.05 times
        decrease in median expression, respectively (
      - Figure 2
      - ', '
      - Figure 2—figure supplement 1
      - >-
        ). Serum lot two gave similar results, although there were variations in
        the number of genes identified as silent or active as well as the degree
        of increase among the conditions (
      - Figure 2
      - ', '
      - Figure 2—figure supplement 1
      - >-
        ). This compares to the original study that identified 755 active genes
        with a median expression of 7.06, and 514 silent genes with a median
        expression of 0.00 (more than half the silent genes did not have a
        reported expression value). Active genes in the original study,
        increased 91% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 96% from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 87% from 1
        hr to 24 hr upon c-Myc induction, corresponding to a 1.23, 2.45, and
        1.99 times increase in median expression, respectively. Silent genes in
        the original study, increased 23% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 29% from 0 hr to 24
        hr, and 30% from 1 hr to 24 hr, with the median expression unchanged
        among conditions. In addition, we further examined the extent of overlap
        of active and silent genes between the original study and this
        replication attempt. Of the 1212 genes that were interrogated in both
        studies, 88.8% (603/679) of the active genes we identified in serum lot
        one were also active in the original study (90.1% (612/679) for serum
        lot two). For silent genes, 96.4% (456/473) of the genes we identified
        as silent in serum lot one were common with the silent genes identified
        in the original study (95.8% (453/473) for serum lot two).

        To test whether active genes, as well as silent genes, increased

        as outlined in the Registered Report (
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'

        ). This analysis differed from what was reported in the original study
        by analyzing the data as paired instead of unpaired. As suggested during
        peer review of the Registered Report, this is because expression of the
        same gene, analyzed across different conditions, is not independent (

        ). We performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on active genes comparing
        expression at 0 hr to 1 hr, 0 hr to 24 hr, and 1 hr to 24 hr, which were
        statistically significant for cells grown in both lots of serum (
      - Table 1
      - >-
        ). The same comparisons were performed on silent genes, which were also
        statistically significant, with the exception of the silent gene
        comparison of 1 hr to 24 hr for serum lot one. Considering this was not
        the test reported in the original study, we conducted these paired
        analyses on the original data to provide a direct comparison. For both
        active and silent genes c-Myc induction resulted in statistically
        significant increases in expression, with the exception of the silent
        gene comparison from 0 hr to 1 hr (
      - Table 1
      - >-
        ). This is in contrast to the results of the unpaired tests that were
        reported in the original study where active genes were reported to have
        a statistically significant increase in expression and silent genes were
        reported as not statistically significant for all comparisons. We
        conducted an exploratory unpaired analysis on the replication data for
        comparison, which resulted in statistically significant differences
        among the active gene comparisons as well as half of the silent gene
        comparisons (
      - Table 2

        Importantly, though, the question of whether the change in expression
        among active genes is different than silent genes has not been tested.
        This would require a separate test on their difference (
      - 'Gelman and Stern, 2006'
      - '; '
      - 'Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011'
      - >-
        ). To test whether active genes increased in expression during c-Myc
        induction more than silent genes, we performed an exploratory analysis
        on the difference in expression of active genes during c-Myc induction
        (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr) compared to the difference in expression of
        silent genes over that same period (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr). For both
        the original and replication data, there was a statistically significant
        increase in expression of active genes compared to silent genes (
      - Table 3
      - >-
        ). This suggests that active genes and silent genes do not have similar
        rates of expression upon c-Myc induction. To summarize, for this
        experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the
        original study and suggest that while both active and silent genes
        increased in expression upon c-Myc induction, the rate of increase was
        different.

        The original study and this replication attempt used the same criteria
        to characterize a gene as silent or active, but there are many negative
        consequences of dichotomizing continuous variables, such as information
        loss, especially with a small gene set (
      - 'Altman and Royston, 2006'
      - '; '
      - 'Cohen, 1983'
      - >-
        ). Papers published after the original study took an unbiased view by
        collecting comprehensive RNA-sequencing data to assess if the
        transcriptional effects of c-Myc were direct or indirect, concluding
        c-Myc activates and represses transcription of discrete gene sets, which
        in turn leads to induced RNA amplification (
      - 'Sabò et al., 2014'
      - '; '
      - 'Walz et al., 2014'
      - >-
        ). Furthermore, Sabò and colleagues also used NanoString technology to
        quantify a subset of the differentially expressed genes identified by
        RNA-seq and observed similar results that revealed upward shifts in gene
        expression upon c-Myc induction (
      - 'Sabò et al., 2014'
      - >-
        ). However, instead of dichotomizing genes as active or silent, gene
        expression data was presented as continuous. Similarly, we presented the
        digital gene expression data generated during this replication attempt
        as continuous, which illustrates a general pattern of overall increased
        gene expression following c-Myc induction (
      - Figure 2—figure supplement 2
      - >-
        ). Importantly, though, these results are limited to the 1369 genes
        interrogated in this study and may or may not reflect how the entire
        transcriptome of P493-6 cells respond to c-Myc induction.

        We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to combine

        analysis plan (
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'

The estimate of the effect size of one study, as well as the associated uncertainty (i.e. confidence interval), compared to the effect size of the other study provides another approach to compare the original and replication results ('

      - 'Valentine et al., 2011'

        reflection of not only the confidence level (e.g. 95%), but also
        variability of the sample (e.g. 
      - SD

        Noticeably, there was substantial within-study variation observed in
        this replication attempt, due the different serum lots tested. The point
        estimate of serum lot one was not within the confidence intervals of the

        There were six comparisons of the gene expression data, three for active

        point estimate of each study (original, replication serum lot one,
        replication serum lot two) was not within the confidence interval of the

Furthermore, for the 0 hr to 1 hr comparison the original study and replication studies were in opposite directions, while the 1 hr to 24 hr comparison was consistent. Finally, the comparison between 0 hr and 24 hr for silent genes was consistent when considering direction of the effect with a statistically significant meta-analysis ('

        replication studies with different serum lots were within the confidence
        intervals of the original study and each other. Overall, the gene
        expression analysis indicates that the effect sizes observed from the
        two serum lots tested in this replication attempt, although not
        identical, were more similar to each other than to the original study.

        This direct replication provides an opportunity to understand the
        present evidence of these effects. Any known differences, including
        reagents and protocol differences, were identified prior to conducting
        the experimental work and described in the Registered Report (
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'

        ). However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original
        paper and through communication with the original authors, which means
        there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol
        that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as
        the cell line, induction time course, and the method used to measure
        gene expression were maintained, others were changed at the time of
        study design (
      - 'Blum et al., 2015'
      - ') that could affect results, such as the analytical approach ('

      - ) and serum lot (
      - 'Leek et al., 2010'
