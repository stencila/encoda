<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Predicting phenotypic evolution on the short-term of tens to hundreds of generations, particularly in changing environments and under finite population sizes, is an important theoretical goal. Because organisms are not simply collections of independent traits, making headway into this goal requires understanding if the phenotypic plasticity of ancestral populations aligns with the phenotypic dimensions that contain more genetic variation for selection to be effective and eventually feedback on the maintenance of genetic variation and promote adaptation or rescue from extinction. By performing 50 generations of experimental evolution in a changing environment we show that ancestral phenotypic plasticity for locomotion behavior in the partially-outcrossing nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is nonadaptive because it does not align with the phenotypic dimension encompassing most genetic variance in the ancestral population and is of no consequence to future phenotypic divergence. Despite evolution of the genetic structure of locomotion behavior we are able to predict the direction of phenotypic divergence, but not the magnitude, based on the genetic covariances between the component traits of locomotion behavior and fitness of the ancestral population. We further demonstrate that indirect selection on the component traits of locomotion behavior with unobserved trait(s) is responsible for the observed phenotypic divergence on them. Our findings indicate that selection theory can predict the direction of short-term adaptive phenotypic evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phenotypic evolution should be considered in the context of the whole organism, as organisms are not just collections of independent traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>). Theory indicates that stabilizing and disruptive selection on each trait, and correlated selection between trait combinations, which together define the individual &#x201C;selection surface&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Phillips and Arnold, 1989</xref>), will shape standing additive genetic variances of traits and covariances between traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arnold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lande, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Svensson et al., 2021</xref>), as summarized by the <bold>G</bold> matrix describing the traits&#x2019; genetic structure that is inherited between parents and offspring. This is because the phenotypic dimensions with greater additive genetic variation allow less constrained responses to directional selection and thus more rapid adaptation to novel environments or rescue from extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blows and McGuigan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chevin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lande, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schluter, 1996</xref>). Theory also suggests that <italic>de novo</italic> input of genetic covariances by pleiotropic mutations, if variable, could in the long-term of mutation-selection balance (time being scaled by the effective population size), be aligned with the orientations of the selection surface and eventually explain phenotypic divergence between populations and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jones et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2014</xref>). However, many studies of natural populations find more standing genetic variation than that expected at mutation-selection balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>), and it is not entirely clear that the <bold>G</bold> matrix can evolve to align with the selection surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Steppan et al., 2002</xref>), in part because selection might not be constant or uniform when populations are faced with changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Careau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chevin and Haller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gomulkiewicz and Houle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guzella et al., 2018</xref>), in part because all populations are finite, mutations rare, founder effects common, and drift on the <bold>G</bold> matrix likely to alter phenotypic evolution on the short-term of tens to hundreds of generations, before mutation-selection balance is reached (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Mallard et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Matuszewski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Whitlock et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>When populations are challenged in a novel environment it is possible that phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a genotypes to express alternative trait values under environmental variation, aids immediate population persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ghalambor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pfennig et al., 2010</xref>), but for adaptive phenotypic divergence to then occur the plastic phenotypic dimension should align with the dimension where most genetic variation is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Draghi and Whitlock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gomulkiewicz and Holt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Price et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Via and Lande, 1985</xref>). Adaptation or rescue from extinction can be hampered if less genetic variation is available for selection in the relevant phenotypic dimensions. A recent meta-analysis of natural populations has found that phenotypic dimensions of plasticity and genetic variation are aligned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Noble et al., 2019</xref>), despite great heterogeneity among the studies surveyed, suggesting that the development and physiology responsible for the traits&#x2019; expression under environmental variation reflect the distribution of pleiotropic mutational effects due to past correlated selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Draghi and Whitlock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Morrissey, 2015</xref>). Yet, several studies found that the phenotypic plasticity of ancestral populations does not always match the phenotypic directions of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ghalambor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ho and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Koch and Guillaume, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mallard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sikkink et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that selection is often misunderstood.</p>
<p>While accounting for phenotypic plasticity is relatively straightforward in lab populations, or natural populations that can be transplanted between environments, the same cannot be said about understanding selection. Estimates of selection will be biased in strength or kind if unobserved traits impacting fitness are genetically correlated with the observed traits or there is correlated selection because of environmental covariances between observed and unobserved traits with fitness, both instances of &#x201C;indirect&#x201D; selection on the observed traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Morrissey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rausher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>). Lande&#x2019;s equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lande, 1979</xref>), <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="493855v1_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, models trait evolution over one generation in the multivariate context <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="493855v1_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as a function of the <bold>G</bold> matrix and the directional selection gradients on each trait (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic>), while explicitly considering potential correlated selection between the observed traits and stabilizing/disruptive selection on each one of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lande and Arnold, 1983</xref>), but might fail when unobserved traits are important. Using the Robertson secondary theorem of natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robertson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>), <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="493855v1_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, however, observed mean trait changes over one generation are accurately predicted because the responses due to selection, i.e., the selection differentials, equal the breeding value change of the trait affecting fitness and thus the additive genetic covariance of the trait with relative fitness (w), independently of unobserved traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Morrissey and Bonnet, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Morrissey et al., 2010</xref>). However, distinguishing direct from indirect selection on each trait is not possible with the Robertson equation, and further the parental trait breeding values must have no transmission bias, due for example to non-Mendelian segregation or to transgenerational environmental effects, and be fully mapped onto offspring trait breeding values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Price, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To help resolve these problems, and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Etterson and Shaw (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Morrissey et al. (2012)</xref> among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stinchcombe et al. (2014)</xref> have proposed in a single statistical framework to apply the Robertson equation in a presumed ancestral population, before phenotypic divergence, to predict the direction of trait evolution because of selection, and in a second step to apply Lande&#x2019;s equation to infer the gradients of directional selection on each trait: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="493855v1_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; where the selection differential <italic>s</italic>, or the trait response <italic>R</italic> because of selection after one generation, is defined by the difference between the trait means for an observed ancestral population <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="493855v1_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and the expected trait means of a divergent population as predicted by the Robertson equation<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="493855v1_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. For example, if the &#x201C;genetic&#x201D; selection gradient during the period considered (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) is not inferred, or is different from the Lande&#x2019;s &#x201C;phenotypic&#x201D; selection gradient obtained by the regression of divergent onto ancestral trait values (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic>), then phenotypic divergence must have been due to indirect selection. This framework is appropriate for a single generation and it is unknown if it can be applied to multiple generations and changing selection surfaces. Furthermore, as the <bold>G</bold> matrix evolves by selection, drift or mutation, the prediction of phenotypic divergence from the Robertson equation and the inference of selection with Lande&#x2019;s equation likely becomes inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Phillips and McGuigan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shaw et al., 1995</xref>), though we lack expectations of when they become so, except for models at mutation-selection balance that notably disregard drift, strong selection or reduced effective recombination between fitness loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arnold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lande, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mallard et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We here report a test of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stinchcombe et al. (2014)</xref> proposal by doing experimental evolution from standing genetic variation in the partially-outcrossing nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and following as a phenotype the worms&#x2019; locomotion behaviour. Locomotion behavior is described by six statistically independent traits of transition rates between movement state and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>), measured in a common scale with no need for transformation to apply selection theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Houle et al., 2011</xref>). We started by characterizing the broad-sense <bold>G</bold> matrices of a lab population in the low salt concentration environment where it had adapted to for 140 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chelo and Teot&#x00F3;nio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Noble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Teot&#x00F3;nio et al., 2012</xref>), as well as in a novel high salt concentration environment, by measuring locomotion differences between inbred lines derived from the outbreeding population. We have previously shown that the broad-sense <bold>G</bold> matrix is an adequate surrogate of the true narrow-sense additive <bold>G</bold> matrix of experimental outbreeding populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>), but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>) and Discussion. We then challenged the lab adapted population to a gradually increasing salt concentration environment for 35 generations, followed by 15 generations in constant high salt and measured locomotion behavior in three derived replicate populations. We also before showed that derived populations adapted to the high salt conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al., 2014</xref>), and thus here ask if the Robertson equation, when applied to the ancestral lab adapted population, predicts 50 generations of locomotion behavior evolution in the novel high and ancestral low salt environments, and whether direct and indirect selection have a bearing on the observed transition rate divergence in the target high salt environment, using Lande&#x2019;s equation.</p>

<title>Experimental populations</title>
<p>Three replicate populations were derived from an outbreeding population (named A6140; &#x201C;A&#x201D; for androdioecious, &#x201C;6&#x201D; for replicate six, &#x201C;140&#x201D; for generations of lab evolution), previously adapted to standard lab conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Noble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Teot&#x00F3;nio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al., 2014</xref>). A6140 in turn resulted from the hybridization of 16 founder strains during 33 generations followed by 140 4-day discrete and non-overlapping life-cycles at <italic>N</italic> = 10<sup>4</sup> census sizes at the time of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Teot&#x00F3;nio et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> = 10<sup>3</sup> effective population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chelo and Teot&#x00F3;nio, 2013</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an androdioecious roundworm, where hermaphrodites can self but only outcross when mated with males. Natural populations are depauperate of genetic diversity and males are rare due to a long history of selfing, selective sweeps and background selection (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rockman et al., 2010</xref>). Under our lab conditions, however, partial-outcrossing is readily maintained at frequencies between 60&#x0025;-80&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Teot&#x00F3;nio et al., 2012</xref>). During domestication populations were maintained in 10x 9cm Petri dishes NGM-lite agar media containing 25mM NaCl and a lawn of <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115 that served as food from the L1 larval stage until reproduction. Periodic population samples were cryogenetically stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Stiernagle, 1999</xref>), allowing for contemporaneous comparisons between ancestral and derived populations after revival of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Teot&#x00F3;nio et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we report the evolution of locomotion behavior in three replicate populations (named GA[1,2,4] populations: &#x201C;G&#x201D; for gradual, &#x201C;A&#x201D; for androdioecious, &#x201C;1,2,4&#x201D; for replicate number) derived from A6140. GA populations were maintained in exactly the same conditions as during domestication except that the NGM-lite media was supplemented with 8mM of NaCl at each generation for 35 generations and then kept constant at 305mM NaCl for an additional 15 generations. Details about the derivation of the GA populations can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al. (2014)</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al. (2014)</xref> we showed, using competitions assays between ancestral and derived populations, that there was adaptation and further in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al. (2019)</xref> that there was maintenance of partial-outcrossing and heterozygosity of about 0.25 for 1 single nucleotide variant per kbp by the end of the 50 generations of evolution. Control populations were also kept in the domestication environment and the evolution of locomotion behavior in these populations is described in a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>). Throughout we refer to the NGM-lite 305mM NaCl environment as the &#x201C;high&#x201D; salt target environment, while the domestication 25mM NaCl environment as the &#x201C;low&#x201D; salt environment.</p>

<title>Inbred lines and fitness</title>
<p>We derived inbred lines by selfing single hermaphrodites from the ancestor (A6140) and the three replicate populations at generation 50 (GA[1,2,4]50) for at minimum of 10 generations (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>). The total number of lines obtained and phenotyped for locomotion behavior can be found in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al. (2019)</xref> we measured individual hermaphrodite self-fertility in high salt, a trait that here we use as a surrogate for fitness. Fertility was measured under environmental conditions that closely followed those of experimental evolution, except for density and presence of males. The log-transformed, covariate-adjusted fertility values (best linear unbiased estimates) for each inbred line were downloaded from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al. (2019)</xref>, exponentiated, and divided by the mean to obtain a relative fitness measure (<italic>w</italic>).</p>

<title>Locomotion behavior</title>
<p>Inbred lines were thawed from frozen stocks on 9 cm Petri plates and grown until exhaustion of food. This occurred 2-3 generations after thawing, after which individuals were washed adults removed by centrifugation, and three plates per line seeded with 1000 larvae at mixed larval stages. Samples were then maintained for one to two complete generations in the standard domestication environment. At the assay generation (generation 4-6 generations post-thaw), starvation-synchronized L1 larvae were seeded in both the low and high-salt environments. Adults were phenotyped for locomotion behaviour 48h later at their usual time of reproduction in one 9cm plate. At the beginning of each assay we measured ambient temperature and humidity in the imaging room. Given the number of lines phenotyped we repeated this protocol several times by the same experimenter, each defining a statistical &#x201C;block&#x201D;, usually including samples from A6140 and from one of the GA populations, over a period of three years (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In total, we phenotyped 188 lines from the A6140 population and 61,61 and 42 lines from each of the GA[1,2,4] populations, with most lines being phenotyped twice and always in separate blocks (average 1.9 in low salt, 2 in high salt).</p>
<p>We imaged adult hermaphrodites using the Multi-Worm Tracker [version 1.3.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Swierczek et al. (2011)</xref>], and followed the protocols detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al. (2019)</xref> to collect the data. Each movie contains about 1000 tracks of hermaphrodites (called objects) with a mean duration of about 1 minute. Standardized to a common frame rate, we filtered and extracted the number and persistence of tracked objects per movie, and assigned movement states across consecutive frames as forward, still or backwards (assuming forward as the dominant direction of movement).</p>
<p>Modeling transitions rates has also been detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al. (2019)</xref>. Briefly, expected transition rates between forward, still and backward movement states follow a continuous time Markov process, and given the constraint that self-transition rates equal the sum of the six non-self transition rates, we considered that these non-self transition rates are independent [called <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> for notation consistency with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al. (2019)</xref>]. For estimation we used log-likehood models specified in RStan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stan Development Team (2018)</xref>, R version 3.3.2, RStan version 2.15.1], which performs Bayesian inference to calculate the posterior probability of the parameters&#x2019; distribution given the observed data.</p>

<p>We modeled divergence of locomotion behavior after 50 generations of evolution using two different formulations.

<p>The significance of fixed effects were tested with Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT, approximately <italic>&#x03C7;</italic><sup>2</sup> distributed), using the <italic>anova</italic> command in R with arguments being the two nested models containing or not the fixed effect being tested.

<title>G matrices</title>
<p>We estimated <bold>G</bold> matrices separately for each of the four studied populations (A6140, GA[1,2,4]50). We present results for the A6140 population in the low and high salt environment, for GA[1,2,4]50 only in the high salt environment. The 6 transition rates <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> were fitted as a multivariate response variable <italic>y</italic> in the model:

The matrix of genetic (co)variances is then half the line (co)variance matrix (<italic>&#x03B6;</italic><sub><italic>lineID</italic></sub>), as we have measured inbred lines we twice count genetic effects. We have elsewhere showed that selection is significant during inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>), but we have also shown that it does not on average change the mean transition rate values in low salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>). The broad-sense <bold>G</bold> matrix as estimated here should thus be an adequate surrogate for the narrow-sense <bold>G</bold> matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lynch and Walsh, 1998</xref>), and see Discussion.</p>
<p>Models were fit with the R package <italic>MCMCglmm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hadfield, 2010</xref>). We constructed priors as the matrix of phenotypic variances for each trait. Model convergence was verified by visual inspection of the posterior distributions and an autocorrelation below 0.05. 100,000 burn-in iterations were done with a thinning interval of 2,000 and a total of over 2 million MCMC iterations.</p>
<p>We define the main axis of genetic variation <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> as the first eigenvector of our A6140 <bold>G</bold>-matrix, <italic>g</italic><sub>2&#x2212;6</sub> its subsequent eigenvectors and <italic>&#x03BB;</italic><sub>1&#x2212;6</sub> their six eigenvalues. To describe the genetic dimensions of divergence among all the four populations (A6140 and GA[1,2,4]50), we performed spectral decomposition of the four <bold>G</bold> matrices in high salt; for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguirre et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Morrissey and Bonnet (2019)</xref>. <bold>G</bold>-matrix differences in this analysis are described by orthogonal eigentensors, which in turn can be decomposed into eigenvectors with associated eigenvalues. We define the first of these eigenvectors as the genetic divergence vector <italic>e</italic><sub>11</sub> as it is the phenotypic dimension encompassing most of the genetic differences between all four <bold>G</bold> matrices.</p>
<p>As discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Walter et al. (2018)</xref>, the significance of the posterior mean variance-covariance estimate is based on the overlap between the posterior null distribution of the posterior mean with the observed posterior mean. We consider that differences between the estimated empirical distributions can be inferred when their 80&#x0025; credible intervals (strickly 83&#x0025;) do not overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Austin and Hux, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Locomotion behavior in the ancestral population</title>
<p>Our ancestral population (A6140) evolved for 140 generations in a defined lab environment characterized in part by low salt (25mM NaCl) in the worms&#x2019; growing media (see Methods). We found significant phenotypic plasticity for locomotion behavior between the low salt environment and a novel high salt (305mM NaCl) environment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Only for one of the six transition rates measured to describe locomotion behavior, the transition rate between backward and forward movement did not show plasticity (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Three transition rates increased (still to/from forward and backward to still) and two decreased (still/forward to backward) in high salt when compared with low salt.</p>

<p>We next partitioned the phenotypic (co)variances of our six transition rates among the inbred lines of A6140 into genetic and error (co)variances in each salt environment. We find that the structure of the two <bold>G</bold> matrices is quite similar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). First, there is no detectable difference in the total genetic variance of the <bold>G</bold> matrices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, in both environments, locomotion behavior is modular (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Transition rates from still to forward or backward, i.e. leaving the still state, are negatively correlated with the remaining transition rates and these positively correlated with each other. Third, eigen decomposition of the <bold>G</bold> matrix in low salt shows that it is rounder than that of high salt, but differences are not important (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The first eigenvector dimension (<italic>g</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>) encompasses most genetic variation in both environments, and they are aligned as the angle between them is small (mean &#x00B1; 95 CI: 12.6<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>[4.4 &#x2212; 21.6]).</p>

Among replicates, significant phenotypic divergence for four out of the six transition rates is also observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Phenotypic divergence was not limited by the amount of genetic variance, as the backward to still and forward to still transition rates diverged while showing the lowest genetic variance in the ancestral population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>The phenotypic dimension which contains most genetic variation in the ancestral A6140 population (<italic>g</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>) aligns with the dimension of phenotypic divergence (&#x0394;<italic>D</italic>) in the the target high salt environment, as the angle between both vectors is small (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). There was consistent parallel genetic divergence of the three replicate populations because the main dimension of genetic divergence (<italic>e</italic><sub>11</sub>) between them and the ancestor also aligns with the <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> of the ancestor. As a consequence, phenotypic divergence (&#x0394;<italic>D</italic>) and genetic divergence (<italic>e</italic><sub>11</sub>) follow similar directions. As expected from the analysis in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, phenotypic divergence did not follow ancestral phenotypic plasticity (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Selection and locomotion behavior divergence</title>
<p>Robertson&#x2019;s selection differentials could predict phenotypic divergence in the target high salt because the are defined as the genetic covariances between traits and relative fitness (see Introduction). These genetic covariances were jointly estimated with the matrix <bold>G</bold><sub><italic>qw</italic></sub>, combining the inbred line transition rates and relative fertility means for the ancestral population (see Methods). We assume that fertility is a good proxy for fitness.</p>
<p>The <bold>G</bold> matrix presented above is robust to the <bold>G</bold><sub><italic>qw</italic></sub> matrix estimation (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). Transition rate covariances with fertility, for example, reflect the modularity found in the <bold>G</bold>-matrix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), as they show signed covariances with fertility similar as those between each other. In high salt, the six transition rate covariances with fertility are different from zero, while in low salt they are not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Fitness variance in the ancestral population at the high salt environment is high, unlike in the low salt environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>), confirming that the domestication to the low salt environment and that the high salt environment is a &#x201C;stressful&#x201D; environment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>For all transition rates in high salt, Robertson&#x2019;s expected responses to selection (<italic>R</italic>) match well with the observed phenotypic divergence (&#x0394;<italic>D</italic>) as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>. We further computed the angles between the predicted and observed phenotypic divergence vectors and also find a good match between them (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). But while in high salt the direction of phenotypic divergence is predicted for all 6 transition rates, its magnitude was not (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>): across all populations, observed divergence is only on average 1.3 times the expected per-generation divergence. In the low salt environment predictions for the direction of phenotypic divergence degenerate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6BC</xref>).</p>
<p>Direct selection on transition rates, as measured by the genetic directional selection gradients (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>), were computed as the inverse of the ancestral <bold>G</bold>-matrix obtained from the <bold>G</bold><sub><italic>qw</italic></sub> matrix and the vector of selection differentials (<italic>s</italic>). We find that <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> are not different from zero, except perhaps for the transition rate between still and backward where it may be positive (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). From the <bold>G</bold><sub><italic>qw</italic></sub> modeling we also obtained the vector of selection differentials between transition rates in low salt and fertility in high salt. Unsurprisingly, <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> on low salt transition rates are not different from zero (not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We did experimental evolution with partially-outcrossing <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations harboring standing genetic variation in a gradually increasing salt environment for 35 generations followed by 15 generations in constant high salt. We have previously shown that these partial-outcrossing populations exposed to changing salt environments purged deleterious recessives alleles while maintaining genetic diversity during the 50 generations of evolution, either due to associative overdominance or true overdominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>). The derived populations adapted to the high salt conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al., 2014</xref>), and thus here we could ask: 1) if plasticity in the transition rates between movement and direction of locomotion behavior were aligned with the phenotypic dimension where more genetic variation is found in the ancestral population and, as a consequence, help explain adaptive phenotypic divergence in high salt; 2) whether or not 50 generations of phenotypic divergence could be predicted from the ancestral genetic covariances of transition rates with fitness in high salt, using Robertson&#x2019;s secondary theorem of natural selection; and 3) if direct and/or indirect selection on transitions was responsible for phenotypic divergence, using Lande&#x2019;s equation with Robertson&#x2019;s selection differentials. For an analysis of selection on locomotion behavior, and the evolution of the <bold>G</bold> matrix, in a constant low salt environment we refer the reader to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al. (2019)</xref>.</p>
<p>Fifty generations of experimental evolution in changing salt conditions led to phenotypic divergence in the target high salt environment for at least 5 out of the 6 transition rates, and in the low salt environment for 3 out of the 6 transitions rates, although there was heterogeneity between replicate populations. In the ancestral population, and in both salt environments, transition rates between still and forward (SF) and still and backwards (SB) form different behavioral modules as these traits show positive genetic covariances with each other, and negative genetic covariances with all other transition rates. Gene expression in our populations is restricted to being active (leaving the still state) and not the direction of movement. In itself this observation is interesting because it explains why phenotypic divergence in SF and SB is of different sign than that of the other 4 transition rates, and because it also explains why the phenotypic dimension encompassing most genetic variation of the ancestral population aligns well with the main dimensions of both phenotypic divergence and genetic divergence among all populations in high salt. However, many studies of neuronal, muscular or metabolic function using mutants have suggested that engaging in activity can be decoupled from the direction of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Bono and Maricq, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhen and Samuel, 2015</xref>) and elsewhere we have described little mutational pleiotropy for transition rates for two strains founders of our populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mallard et al., 2022</xref>). The evolution of genetic covariances between transition rates in our populations should therefore result mostly from the frequency dynamics of relevant alleles in linkage disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lande, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Phillips and McGuigan, 2006</xref>). See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mallard et al. (2022)</xref> for a discussion on the role of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium in some of our populations.</p>
<p>Several authors have suggested that ancestral phenotypic plasticity will be aligned with the phenotypic dimensions with more standing genetic variation, or mutational input, and thus facilitate adaptation if past correlated selection between traits led to the evolution of plasticity in particular dimensions of trait combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Draghi and Whitlock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jones et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2014</xref>). Empirical tests of this idea are few. In a meta-analysis of several studies in natural populations phenotypic plasticity generally matched phenotypic dimensions with more genetic variation but did not depend on the degree of environmental stress and thus, presumably, on selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Noble et al., 2019</xref>). More explicitly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Johansson et al. (2021)</xref> have showed that phenotypic plasticity for life-history and morphological trait responses to changes in photoperiod in damselflies was aligned with phenotypic dimensions with more genetic variation but only in populations facing selection because of photoperiod seasonality, as expected from theory. In our study, the <bold>G</bold> matrix is very similar in the low and high salt environments for the ancestral population, and the phenotypic dimension with more genetic variation in high salt neither aligns well with that of phenotypic plasticity nor the phenotypic dimension where plasticity is found contains much genetic variation. It is thus not surprising that the mismatch between plasticity and genetics does not impede or facilitate adaptive phenotypic divergence.</p>
<p>One of the main results of our study is that the direction of phenotypic divergence for at least 5 out of 6 transition rates in high salt is predicted using Robertson&#x2019;s equation. The direction of divergence in the transition rate between still and forward is not predicted, even if it has a detectable genetic covariance with fitness because of replicate population heterogeneity and perhaps a founder sampling effect when establishing them. Yet, these are remarkable findings, especially when considering that the individual selection surface likely changed during the first 35 generations of the experiment, and that the <bold>G</bold> matrix in high salt evolved during the 50 generations, by drift and selection, cf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guzella et al., 2018</xref>), mostly through a reduction in genetic variance across all phenotypic dimensions. The selection surface probably changed during evolution but only in strength, because only one environmental factor was employed and the nature of change across generations was linear on the mean environmental value, not the variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chevin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Proulx and Teot&#x00F3;nio, 2017</xref>). That the Robertson equation predicts phenotypic divergence is also remarkable because fertility is only a component of fitness. Indeed, we previously were unable to measure increased fertility in high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>), despite obvious adaptation &#x2013; as measured with competition assays between ancestral and derived populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Teot&#x00F3;nio et al., 2017</xref>), see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al. (2014)</xref> &#x2013;. Our analysis demonstrates that even if we estimated broad-sense genetic covariances between transition rates and fertility they are nonetheless adequate surrogates of the additive genetic covariances of outbreeding populations, as required by Robertson&#x2019;s equation.</p>
<p>But while characterization of genetic covariances between transition rates and fertility in high salt in the ancestral population is sufficient to predict the direction of phenotypic evolution in the target high salt environment, we cannot predict with much accuracy the direction of phenotypic evolution in the (ancestral) low salt environment, and hence we cannot predict the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. The simplest explanation for this finding is that the ancestral population contained low and significant levels of genetic covariances between transition rates in low salt and fitness in high salt, but that these covariances were undetectable given sample sizes we have. In low salt, transition rates are effectively neutral and could have only diverged by being genetically correlated with high salt traits under selection. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al. (2019)</xref> we have described that phenotypic stasis of locomotion behaviour in populations facing constant low salt results from effective stabilizing selection over a large phenotypic space after adaptation, cf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haller and Hendry, 2014</xref>), and that after adaptation, Robertson&#x2019;s equation of little use to predict evolution over local phenotypic space because in this local space genetic covariances between transition rates and fitness are small and mostly evolve by drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mallard et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The Robertson equation has been applied to a few natural populations, those where time series of trait and fitness values are concurrently obtained with pedigrees such that trait breeding values can be estimated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biquet et al. (2022)</xref> provide an exemplary study of a blue tit population that has been followed for more than 40 years, and in which egg laying has changed to earlier and earlier spring dates, presumably because of climate change. Despite significant heritability for egg laying date and selection on it, however, modeling the expected breeding values for laying date did not reveal any temporal trend consistent with a general lack of genetic covariance between laying date and fitness during the whole period followed. There was thus no evolution, meaning no genetic divergence for laying date, which the authors can attribute to the stochastic nature of individual development to maturity. Using a similar approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bonnet et al. (2017)</xref> have found on the contrary that evolution towards earlier dates of parturition in a red deer population (also over 40 years and also presumably because of climate change) could be predicted and were consistent with the estimated change of parturition date breeding values. What our study suggests is that for organisms where pedigrees are difficult to obtain, and thus trait breeding values difficult to estimate, such as small organisms that cannot be marked and those with a rapid or complex life-cycle, for example, one may be able to measure the genetic covariance of the traits of interest with fitness in an ancestral population, to predict the direction of adaptive future phenotypic divergence on the short-term of a few tens of generations.</p>
<p>A second major finding of our study is that we were unable to infer direct selection on transition rates, despite phenotypic divergence in a majority of them, as directional selection gradient estimates were not obviously different from zero. There are two explanations for this result: either unobserved traits under direct selection are genetically correlated with observed ones or there is correlated selection between observed and unobserved traits because of unknown environmental covariances of them with fitness. A recent study in wild salmon as shown that selection due to human harvesting of a prey species (for feeding cultured salmon) explained divergence for early maturity and small body sizes, despite selection for increased body size at maturity because of fishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Czorlich et al., 2022</xref>). In an example privileging the second explanation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kruuk et al. (2002)</xref> have found that despite heritability and directional selection for antler size in red deer there was phenotypic stasis due to nutritional state covariation and antler size. We find it unlikely, however, that a similar situation to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kruuk et al. (2002)</xref> explains our results. This is because worms&#x2019; locomotion behaviour were measured in ancestral and derived populations in &#x201C;common garden&#x201D; assays, after reviving population samples from storage and culturing them under similar environmental conditions for 4-6 generations. Perhaps more importantly, we have also reported that transgenerational environmental effects on the viability of individuals exposed to high salt do not carry over for more than three generations, and are in any case small when compared to the fitness effects of within-generation high salt exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Proulx et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of trait values specific to changing salt environments could be at play, but this would require a genetic basis for individuals to detect and anticipate the higher salt levels of future generations, despite they themselves developing and growing under lower and constant salt levels as was the case during experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Proulx and Teot&#x00F3;nio, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We favor the interpretation that indirect selection on transition rates is due to them being genetically correlated with unobserved traits under direct selection. One candidate trait to be under direct selection is body size at the time of reproduction. In a changing salt environment increased body size could be favored for example because the accumulation of osmolites will lower cuticle tension and enhance individual survival. Body size and locomotion behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are further known to be physiologically regulated in concert not only by the amount of food eaten, and how much energy is spent by growing, foraging, mating or reproducing, but also by the perception of stressful environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujiwara et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2002</xref>). The software tracker that we used to obtain locomotion behavior data also contains information about body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Noble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Swierczek et al., 2011</xref>). Estimates of the genetic covariance between body size and fertility in the ancestral population suggest an expected response to selection in high salt of 0.2, which is similar to the observed body size change after 50 generations of evolution and, coincidentally, a selection gradient of <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 0.2 (&#x2212;0.03-0.46, 95&#x0025; CI). We also find significant genetic covariances between all transition rates and body size (not shown). Many other traits can be implicated, however, for example developmental time, because hermaphrodites engaged in selfing tend to more rapidly resume activity when harassed by males than when self-sperm depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chasnov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>) and delayed maturity favors selfing in this protandrous nematode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Poullet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Theologidis et al., 2014</xref>). Only a more detailed investigation can shed light on the complexity of the selection surface in the high salt environment. Our analysis suggests, however, that indirect selection led to the divergence of locomotion behavior in part because of important genetic covariances between body size and transition rates.</p>
<p>In our experimental evolution model, ancestral plasticity neither hinders nor facilitates phenotypic divergence of locomotion behavior. The direction of phenotypic divergence in the target environment can be predicted from the ancestral genetic covariances of component traits of locomotion behavior with fitness, even if experimental evolution took place in a gradually changing environment until reaching the target environment, for multiple generations, and there was a large reduction of genetic variation affecting locomotion behaviour. Indirect selection seems to be responsible for the phenotypic divergence of locomotion behavior. Together, these findings indicate that selection theory can be used to predict the direction of short-term adaptive phenotypic evolution.</p>
