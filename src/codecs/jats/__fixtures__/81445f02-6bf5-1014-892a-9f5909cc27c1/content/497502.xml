<title>Abstract</title><p>Postmenopausal atherosclerosis has been attributed to estrogen deficiency. The beneficial effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), however, is lost in late postmenopausal women with atherogenesis. We asked whether aging-related iron accumulation affects estrogen receptor &#x03B1; (ER&#x03B1;) expression explaining HRT inefficacy. A negative correlation between aging-related systemic iron deposition and ER&#x03B1; expression in postmenopausal AS patients was established. In an ovariectomized ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model, estradiol treatment had contrasting effects on ER&#x03B1; expression in early versus late postmenopausal mice. ER&#x03B1; expression was inhibited by iron treatment in cell culture and iron-overloaded mice. Combined treatment with estradiol and iron further decreased ER&#x03B1; expression, mediated by iron-regulated E3 ligase Mdm2. In line with these observations, cellular cholesterol efflux was reduced and endothelial homeostasis was disrupted and, consequently, atherosclerosis was aggravated. Accordingly, systemic iron chelation attenuated estradiol-triggered progressive atherosclerosis in late postmenopausal mice. Thus, iron and estradiol together downregulate ER&#x03B1; through Mdm2-mediated proteolysis, explaining failures of HRT in late postmenopausal subjects with aging-related iron accumulation. HRT is recommended immediately after menopause along with appropriate iron chelation to protect from atherosclerosis.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease-associated death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moss <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). It has been well recognized that postmenopausal women confront an increasing risk of AS owing to estrogen deficiency and disturbance of the estrogen receptor (ER) regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moss <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) remains controversial. Women&#x2019;s Health Initiative and the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study reported that the atheroprotective effect of HRT in the late postmenopausal women (commonly ages over 65) is lost or even worsened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hlatky <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rocca <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rossouw <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The underlying mechanism may be triggered by aging, which reduces the protection afforded by estrogen, particularly estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>In general, the atheroprotective effect of estrogen is attributed to its interaction with estrogen receptor &#x03B1; (ER&#x03B1;), which participates in foam cell formation and vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Murphy, 2011</xref>). ER&#x03B1; deletion is reported to induce adiposity and increase atherosclerotic lesion size since the promoters of lipid metabolism-related genes, such as <italic>Tgm2</italic>, <italic>ApoE,</italic> and <italic>Abca1</italic>, contain ER&#x03B1; binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ribas <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition, estrogen binds to ER&#x03B1; tethered to the plasma membrane, which can stimulate vasodilatation via an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-dependent pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Teoh <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Moreover, VEGF promotes angiogenesis and is transcriptionally regulated by the E<sub>2</sub>-ER&#x03B1; complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). ER&#x03B1; expression decreases after menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), suggesting the critical role of ER&#x03B1; in blood vessel function in healthy pre- and postmenopausal women. Despite the above, few studies have focused on the regulation of ER&#x03B1; in postmenopausal women on HRT.</p>
<p>Upon binding, estrogen functions as an ER&#x03B1; activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lung <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) and initiates ER&#x03B1; dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. Estrogen treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to a marked increase in <italic>Esr1</italic> (gene that encodes ER&#x03B1;) mRNA through the binding of the E<sub>2</sub>-ER&#x03B1; complex to estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) in the promoter region of <italic>Esr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pinzone <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Estrogen binding to ER&#x03B1; also rapidly stimulates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ER&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pinzone <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Ubiquitination-dependent ER&#x03B1; cycling on and off the ERE promoter sites to activate or prevent target gene transcription depends on the presence of estrogen at an adequate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou &#x0026; Slingerland, 2014</xref>). Ubiquitin ligases that have been implicated in ER&#x03B1; regulation include BRCA1, MDM2, SKP1&#x2013;CUL1&#x2013;F-box S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SCF<sup>SKP2</sup>), and E6-associated protein (E6AP), all of which promote estrogen-induced transcriptional activity with cell-type selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou &#x0026; Slingerland, 2014</xref>). Of these, MDM2 is a single-subunit RING finger E3 protein, which does not always inversely correlate with ER&#x03B1; levels in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Duong <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The relationship between MDM2 and ER&#x03B1; in other contexts and cell types remains elusive.</p>
<p>Estrogen also regulates systemic iron homeostasis through hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide of 25 amino acids that mediates endocytosis and degradation of the ferrous iron exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nemeth <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The dimeric E<sub>2</sub>-ER&#x03B1; complex binds to an ERE site within the promoter of the hepcidin gene (<italic>Hamp</italic>) to inhibit its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hou <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Hence, E<sub>2</sub> elevates circulating iron to compensate for blood loss during menstruation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Badenhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, E<sub>2</sub> declines by over 90&#x0025; after menopause, while systemic iron content increases slowly by steady iron uptake over the years. Serum ferritin in postmenopausal women increased by 2-3 times compared with premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). We and others have previously reported that iron overload is a risk factor for atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Vinchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Our study relied on using the proatherogenic <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mouse model, which we can manipulate genetically to cause iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We aimed to investigate the impact of aging-related iron accumulation on the therapeutic effect of HRT on AS and explore the underlying mechanisms. First, we corroborated on a new cohort of postmenopausal AS patients that a negative correlation between high concentrations of serum-iron and -ferritin and low expression of ER&#x03B1; exists. We hypothesized that gradual iron accumulation in postmenopausal women could explain poor HRT efficacy when applied at a late stage.</p>
<p>We used <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> aging female mice or ovariectomized (OVX) young mice as estrogen-deficient AS models to examine ER&#x03B1; expression with respect to HRT efficacy and the genetic iron-overload mice in <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background (<italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic>) to address the relation of iron metabolism and HRT efficacy. We found that ER&#x03B1; expression positively responded to E<sub>2</sub> administration under low or normal iron conditions and negatively responded to E<sub>2</sub> administration under high iron conditions. Our results explain the puzzle of HRT in early and late postmenopausal women, and the reason is the accelerated ER&#x03B1; proteolysis through iron-mediated upregulation of <italic>Mdm2</italic>.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study included 20 postmenopausal (at least one year since menopause, without HRT) AS patients aged 54-84 years, recruited from the Vascular Surgery Department, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School. Patients were divided into early (55-65 years old) and late (&#x003E;65 years old) groups since menopause for over ten years was defined as late post-menopause. Twenty fasting serum samples were collected at the outpatient service. Of them, eight patients, undergoing carotid endarterectomy, were recruited, and plaque samples were collected immediately after separation. Exclusion criteria included the current use of oral contraceptives or other medications. Further details on the exclusion criteria were referenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wactawski-Wende <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, approved the study. All patients provided written informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>Animals</title>
<p><italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were obtained from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic> mice on the C57BL/6J background were generated in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). For the control experiments included in Results 2 and 6, female <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at the age of 8 weeks (defined as premenopausal) were anesthetized and bilaterally ovariectomized through a 1 cm dorsal incision. After surgery, mice were allowed to recover for one week and randomly divided into early and late groups. For each group, mice were fed a high-fat diet (0.2&#x0025; cholesterol and 20&#x0025; fat) and injected with saline, E<sub>2</sub> (3 &#x03BC;g/kg every other day, Solarbio, Beijing, China), or E<sub>2</sub>&#x002B;DFP (80 mg/kg daily, Sigma&#x2013;Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for eight weeks from week nine as the early OVX group or week 21 as the late OVX group.</p>
<p>For the control experiments included in Result 3, female <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic> mice were ovariectomized at the age of 16 or 40 weeks. E<sub>2</sub> injection (3 &#x03BC;g/kg every other day) was performed one week after surgery for eight weeks. All animals were housed and fed standard chow in the SPF animal facility with an average 12 h light-and-dark cycle and under controlled temperature conditions (25&#x00B0;C). The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) and euthanized by cervical dislocation for sample collection. The protocols were approved by the Animal Investigation Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School and were performed according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health, USA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<label>2.3</label><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>J774a.1 cells, HUVECs, and MCF-7 cells were purchased from Cellcook (Guangzhou, China) and cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS). Peritoneal macrophages were collected from peritoneal exudates three days after injecting 8-week-old mice with 0.3 ml of 4&#x0025; BBL thioglycollate, Brewer modified (BD Biosciences, Shanghai, China), and then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10&#x0025; (FBS) for 8 h. Macrophages were cultured in a medium containing 50 &#x03BC;g/ml human oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the presence of 1 &#x03BC;M E<sub>2</sub>, 100 &#x03BC;M ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), 350 &#x03BC;M DFP or indicated combination for 48 h as needed.</p>
<p>Oil Red O staining was performed to evaluate foam cell formation. The quantification was carried out with the following formula: relative average area of the fat droplet (&#x0025;) &#x003D; Target (Area of fat droplets/Numbers of cells)/Control (Area of fat droplets/Number of cells)&#x002A;100&#x0025;. The area was analyzed by ImageJ software. Angiogenesis assays were performed to evaluate angiogenic capacity. Cellular iron levels were estimated using ferrozine assays. The protein levels of ER&#x03B1;, ABCA1, VEGF, TfR1, and Ft-L were determined by Western blot analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>Isolation of peritoneal macrophages from mice</title>
<p>The mice were intraperitoneally injected with 4&#x0025; starch broth (NaCl 0.5 g, beef extract 0.3 g, peptone 1.0 g, and starch 3.0 g in 100 ml of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O) 3 days before euthanasia. After anesthesia, the abdominal skin was carefully cut to 1 cm, and 5-8 ml PBS with 3&#x0025; FBS was injected into the enterocoele. After 10 min of massage, the liquid was extracted and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min). The sediment was then plated into 6-well plates for attachment or cryopreserved for further assays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<label>2.5</label><title>Blood samples and tissue collection</title>
<p>The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Blood was drawn from the inferior vena cava and collected in heparinized tubes. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation (1200 &#x00D7;g) for 15 min at 4&#x00B0;C. Plasma samples were then stored at -80&#x00B0;C for the determination of serum iron, lipid and cytokine levels. The mice were then perfused with 4&#x00B0;C saline through the left ventricle. After perfusion, the arteries, hearts, livers, and spleens were harvested. The samples were fixed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde or quickly frozen at -80&#x00B0;C for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<label>2.6</label><title>Serum lipid content and lesion area in the aorta and the aortic root</title>
<p>Lipid content was determined with Oil Red O to stain the aorta. To assess the atherosclerotic lesion area, the aorta was analyzed from the aorta arch to the abdominal aortic bifurcation. The quantification of lesion area and size was performed using ImageJ software. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by the clinical laboratory of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital using an autochemical analyser (Beckman Coulter AU5421, CA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<label>2.7</label><title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Prussian blue staining</title>
<p>Sections of mouse aortic valve or patient carotid artery plaques were used to assess the plaque iron composition by IHC staining for Ft-L and Prussian blue staining with DAB enhancement for ferric iron. The primary antibody against Ft-L was made using recombinant human Ft-L subunit as antigen by GenScript (Nanjing, China).</p>
<p>Images were captured under a light microscope (Leica, Germany). For quantitative analysis of images, three sections per animal at intervals of 30 &#x03BC;m were analyzed. The intensity of positive staining was analyzed by ImageJ software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<label>2.8</label><title>Iron assays</title>
<p>Deparaffinized tissue sections were stained with Prussian blue staining for nonheme iron as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Serum iron was measured by the clinical laboratory of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital using an autochemical analyser (Beckman Coulter AU5421, CA). Total nonheme iron in the tissues was measured by colorimetric ferrozine-based assays as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Briefly, 22 &#x03BC;l concentrated HCl (11.6 M) was added to 100 &#x03BC;l of homogenized tissue samples (approximately 500 &#x03BC;g total protein). The sample was then heated at 95&#x00B0;C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 12000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred into a clean tube. Ascorbate was added to reduce the Fe3<sup>&#x002B;</sup> into Fe2<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. After 2 min of incubation at room temperature, ferrozine and saturated ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) were sequentially added to each tube, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm (BioTek ELx800, Shanghai, China) within 30 min.</p>

<p>To build the link between iron contents and ER&#x03B1; levels in different postmenopausal stages, we collected 8 plaques and 20 blood samples from postmenopausal AS patients, divided a half into Early (55-65 years old, n&#x003D;4/10, plaque/blood samples) and another half into Late (&#x003E;66 years old, n&#x003D;4/10) Post-Menopausal groups, EPM and LPM, respectively. Ferritin was evaluated by IHC, ELISA, and immunoblotting, and iron was evaluated by DAB-enhanced Prussian blue staining. As expected, both ferritin and iron levels were significantly increased in plaques and serum of the LPM, compared to the EPM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C, E</xref>). In addition, serum cholesterol and triglycerides were elevated in the LPM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).

<label>3.2</label><title>AS aggravates in E<sub>2</sub>-treated LPM <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with reduced ER&#x03B1; expression and accumulation of body iron</title>
<p>To determine whether the effect of HRT was atheroprotective in postmenopausal females, ovariectomy (OVX) was performed to mimic post-menopause in <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> female mice at eight weeks of age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The mice started to be fed high-fat chow one week post OVX. Ages of 9 weeks and 21 weeks were considered as EPM and LPM stages, respectively. Although peritoneal E<sub>2</sub> injection in the EPM significantly reduced plaque formation, it remarkably promoted atherosclerotic development in the late application (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), exactly as observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hlatky <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rossouw <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). We then detected aortic ER&#x03B1; expression to evaluate whether ER&#x03B1; was responsive to E<sub>2</sub> treatment. The results showed markedly lower ER&#x03B1; protein levels in the LPM mice than in the EPM mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). More strikingly, ER&#x03B1; expression was further reduced in LPM mice after E<sub>2</sub> treatment but remained constantly high in EPM mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). It has been reported that ER&#x03B1; protects against atherosclerosis by promoting lipid efflux and endothelial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Hence, we assessed three ER&#x03B1; downstream proteins, ABCA1, a lipid exporter whose gene promoter is predicted to have ERE, VEGF, an activator of angiogenesis, and eNOS, a modulator of vasoconstriction and vascular repair. They were all positively correlated with ER&#x03B1; expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Macrophage-derived foam cell formation is crucial in the development of atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We therefore isolated peritoneal macrophages from early and late OVX mice after E2 treatment and surprisingly found that the expression of ER&#x03B1;, ABCA1, and VEGF responded to E<sub>2</sub> treatment similarly as observed in aortic tissue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In line with this observation, serum cholesterol and triglycerides negatively correlated with ER&#x03B1; and ABCA1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Our previous data have demonstrated that macrophage iron plays a critical role in the development of AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>); therefore, iron-related proteins were monitored.</p>

<p>Ferritin was reduced in response to E<sub>2</sub> treatment in the EPM stage.

<label>3.3</label><title>E<sub>2</sub> downregulates ER&#x03B1; expression in an iron-dependent manner</title>
<p>Next, we aimed to identify whether aging or iron overload alone could trigger a decrease in ER&#x03B1; expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this question, myeloid-specific <italic>Fpn1</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic>) were used as a macrophage-iron overload model in the <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). This double knockout (KO) model is considered relevant for AS studies due to the accumulation of a large number of macrophages in plaques, which contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). OVX was performed in female mice fed standard chow at 16 weeks or 40 weeks of age, and E<sub>2</sub> was injected to model HRT, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> show the severity of atherosclerosis, which was significantly enhanced in the E<sub>2</sub>-treated groups at both ages compared to the saline groups of <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic>. Notably, macrophage <italic>Fpn1</italic> KO mice displayed a larger lesion area after E<sub>2</sub> treatment at the EPM and LPM stages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting a dominant influence of iron on the effects of the E<sub>2</sub> treatment. In particular, the specific iron overload in macrophages, characteristic of the mouse model used, was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the lesion area in the LPM group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel), reproducing previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). We then examined the iron status in tissues and serum. Iron levels in tissues (aorta/liver) were higher in <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic> compared to <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, as revealed by ferrozine assays (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref> for EPM groups and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> for LPM groups) and further supported by higher ferritin content (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref> for EPM and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> for LPM). On the contrary, serum iron was lower in <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic> mice at the EPM and LPM stages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>). However, E<sub>2</sub> administration did not significantly reduce the ferritin levels and iron levels in the aorta and liver (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>), confirming that Fpn1 acts as an iron exporter and that macrophages play a crucial role in response to E<sub>2</sub> treatment. E<sub>2</sub> administration significantly increased serum iron levels in the LPM group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) and mildly increased serum iron levels in the EPM group (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>), suggesting that other factors besides iron also contribute to the aging-related physiological changes in the E<sub>2</sub> treatment response. Of note, ER&#x03B1; was downregulated in the aorta of the <italic>Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic>mice and further downregulated by E<sub>2</sub> treatment, accompanied by reduced expression of ABCA1 and VEGF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>), suggesting that both iron alone and iron plus E<sub>2</sub> could downregulate ER&#x03B1; expression in macrophages. Consistent with the severity of atherosclerosis and the alteration of ER&#x03B1; and its target gene ABCA1, serum cholesterol and triglycerides were increased in the <italic>Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic>mice and further increased by E<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine the capacity of lipid export when ER&#x03B1; was downregulated, we loaded J774a.1 with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and observed significantly more lipid accumulation in the E<sub>2</sub>-treated plus iron overload group than in the other groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting a tendency of macrophages to be converted into foam cells.

<label>3.5</label><title>Proteasome-mediated ER&#x03B1; degradation results from the interactive effects of iron overload and E<sub>2</sub> treatment mediated by the E3 ligase Mdm2</title>
<p>We wondered how excess iron and E<sub>2</sub> together downregulated ER&#x03B1; expression. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we first searched for what regulates ER&#x03B1; expression. It was reported that the downregulation of ER&#x03B1; could be attributed to methylation of its promoter region, which could be induced by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lung <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Because iron overload has been massively correlated with oxidative stress, two relevant antioxidative enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2, were evaluated. The results did not show a significant difference between the control and E<sub>2</sub>/FAC treatments (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>). In addition, the mRNA level of ER&#x03B1; was examined and barely showed significant changes after FAC and E<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>), suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of ER&#x03B1; better explained the decreased presence of the receptor after iron and/or E<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p>
<p>As stated previously, ER&#x03B1; may be regulated through an estrogen-ER&#x03B1; binding-dependent ubiquitination signaling pathway for degradation and estrogen recycling. To test this possibility, we treated J774a.1 cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and observed that ER&#x03B1; protein levels were significantly elevated in the presence of E<sub>2</sub> and excess iron (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of eukaryotic translation, showed that the half-life of ER&#x03B1; was shortened in the E<sub>2</sub> &#x002B; FAC group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting a faster turnover rate of ER&#x03B1; in the presence of E<sub>2</sub> plus excess iron, verifying the activation of ER&#x03B1; proteasome degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou &#x0026; Slingerland, 2014</xref>). We then detected the ubiquitination levels of ER&#x03B1; by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The results showed much more ubiquitinated and degraded ER&#x03B1; in the presence of E<sub>2</sub> and excess iron than in other conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), further supporting the proteolysis-dependent pathway for ER&#x03B1; degradation. We then tested a few E3 ligases (BRCA1, AHR, and Mdm2) in J774a.1, which were supposed to regulate ER&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fan <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saji <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), and did not find a negative correlation between BRCA1/AHR and ER&#x03B1; in response to FAC or E<sub>2</sub>&#x002B;FAC treatments (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). However, <italic>Mdm2</italic> was upregulated in the FAC and E<sub>2</sub>&#x002B;FAC groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). When cells J774a.1 and HUVECs were treated with Nutlin-3, a well-known Mdm2 inhibitor, ER&#x03B1; exhibited iron-dependent Mdm2-mediated degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). Amazingly and consistently, Mdm2 expression was upregulated at the LPM stage compared with the EPM stage both in the aorta of female mice and in plaques of AS patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>), which is exactly opposite to ER&#x03B1; expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).

<label>3.6</label><title>Iron restriction therapy restores ER&#x03B1; levels and attenuates E2-triggered progressive atherosclerosis in late postmenopausal mice</title>
<p>To further verify whether iron overload is responsible for the E<sub>2</sub>-induced downregulation of ER&#x03B1; and progressive atherosclerosis in LPM mice, we evaluated the effects of iron restriction. Twenty-one-week-old female <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, OVX-ed at eight weeks of age, received iron chelation therapy through peritoneal injection of DFP (80 mg/kg) daily for eight weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar to the definition used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, 13</xref> weeks after OVX was considered as the LPM stage. Indeed, iron chelation attenuated the plaque-accelerated development of AS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). The contents of serum cholesterol and triglycerides compared with those in the E<sub>2</sub>-only group were significantly diminished (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with previous data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), ferrozine assays proved decreased iron deposition in tissues but increased iron in serum post E<sub>2</sub> application (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>). Although DFP administration reduced the tissue and serum iron levels, it did not induce anemia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>), which was comparable to the mice at EPM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G and H</xref>). We then detected aortic ER&#x03B1; expression and found significant upregulation by iron restriction, along with the upregulation of ABCA1 and VEGF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, iron chelation by DFP significantly reduced Mdm2 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). In agreement with our previous findings in cell-based assays, these results corroborate the concept that late postmenopausal HRT-induced ER&#x03B1; deficiency is, at least partially, iron overload-mediated. Thus, the non-atheroprotective effects of E<sub>2</sub> in the LPM result from aging-mediated iron accumulation.</p>

<p>Estrogen has long been considered atheroprotective and responsible for the low morbidity of cardiovascular diseases in premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lobo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Moss <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, epidemiological studies of the Women&#x2019;s Health Initiative question the beneficial effects of late postmenopausal HRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hlatky <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Although one hypothesis to explain this observation may be that iron potentiates the adverse effects of estrogen in AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sullivan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sullivan, 2003</xref>), a comprehensive <italic>in vivo</italic> study to test this hypothesis was missing. We reported previously that the developmental course of atherosclerosis was highly accelerated in <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> Fpn1<sup>LysM/LysM</sup></italic> mice compared with <italic>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Our present study provides the first experimental evidence that iron overload facilitates ER&#x03B1; proteolysis, which is potentiated in the presence of E<sub>2</sub> and reverses the anti-atherogenic effect of E<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Our results support the benefit of early application of estrogen post-menopause. We propose that the combination of HRT and iron restriction therapy may be a long-term strategy for the preventive effects of E<sub>2</sub> from the development of AS in post-menopausal women.</p>

<label>Figure 7</label>
<caption><title>Schematic model for the effects of postmenopausal iron accumulation with or without HRT on AS severity through modulating ER&#x03B1; expression.</title>
<p>Iron accumulation occurs naturally and gradually after menopause. In EPM, iron retention was mild, and ER&#x03B1; was responsive to HRT application to achieve protective effects (A). However, when iron overload is significant in LPM, Mdm2 is upregulated along with ER&#x03B1; downregulation (B). This negative correlation is potentiated by the application of HRT and iron accumulation with aging. Therefore, HRT use avails to aggravate the progression of AS in the LPM period. Iron chelation, however, reverses the adverse effect of HRT and attenuates the accelerated development of AS (A), suggesting a protective role of appropriate iron restriction in the LPM stage.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="497502v1_fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The controversy of whether or not to proceed with HRT in postmenopausal women is fueled by an increased, although small, risk of breast cancer and from the potentially harmful effect on cardiovascular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lobo, 2017</xref>). Previous randomized trials did not consider the ages sorting out EPM from LPM and have not excluded subjects with iron depletion or loss in the recruited post-menopausal subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sullivan, 2003</xref>). We sorted the recruited female AS volunteers from the Department of Vascular Surgery of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital as EPM and LPM groups to reveal whether aging-associated iron deposition correlates with ER&#x03B1; expression. The negative correlation between systemic iron status and intraplaque ER&#x03B1; expression was validated, which prompted us to address the role of iron in ER&#x03B1; expression.</p>
<p>Previous efforts focused more on the role of estrogen in iron metabolism (primarily the hepcidin/Fpn axis) and not <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hou <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Both genes encoding hepcidin and Fpn are inhibited by E<sub>2</sub> treatment through an estrogen-responsive element (ERE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hou <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qian <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). However, it was also reported that hepcidin expression decreased in the livers of OVX mice through a GPR30-BMP6-dependent mechanism, independent of the ERE-mediated E<sub>2</sub>-ER&#x03B1; pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Though the difference in hepcidin expression in OVX mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowling <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hou <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), the consistent with this study here is that aging, OVX, and genetic manipulation of Fpn induced progressive iron retention in tissues, accompanied by reduced ER&#x03B1; expression. E<sub>2</sub> administration further enhanced this reduction in ER&#x03B1; levels under the above-mentioned conditions. Overall, high ER&#x03B1; levels are found in reproductive women, despite fluctuations caused by the periodic estrogen wave and blood loss in reproductive women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The aging process, particularly in late postmenopausal women, progressively elevates iron levels which we show, downregulates ER&#x03B1;, resulting in insufficient ER&#x03B1; to respond to E<sub>2</sub> treatment. Therefore, HRT is unlikely to result in an effective outcome in LPM women as in EPM women unless it is coupled with an iron-chelating scheme. This is because aggravated AS in LPM women is, at least partially, the result of age-related iron accumulation. We demonstrated the effectiveness of iron chelation in improving HRT outcomes in the mouse model, but further work is required to translate this finding for clinical practice.</p>
<p>ER&#x03B1; is the main effector of estrogen on cardiovascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aryan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Meng <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We wondered how iron downregulated ER&#x03B1;. Since several E3 ubiquitin ligases (<italic>i.e</italic>., CHIP, E6AP, BRCA1, BARD1, SKP2, and Mdm2) have been found to catalyze the covalent binding of ubiquitin to lysine residues of ER&#x03B1; (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tecalco-Cruz &#x0026; Ramirez-Jarquin, 2017</xref>), we tested them and found that Mdm2 is responsive to iron treatment in cells and mice and negatively correlated with ER&#x03B1;, particularly under high iron conditions. Furthermore, we showed that Mdm2 is a negative regulator of ER&#x03B1;.</p>
<p>Our findings may be context specific, as some differences are noted in its studied roles in some cancer cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dongiovanni <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Mdm2 acts as a ubiquitin ligase E3 to p53 in SV40 hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Honda <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) and has been shown to act as a direct coactivator of ER&#x03B1; function in ER&#x03B1;-positive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Saji <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, iron-dependent downregulation was revealed in leukemia cell lines and primary human cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Calabrese <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), suggesting a cell-type-specific regulation of Mdm2 by iron. In our study, the downregulation of Mdm2 by E<sub>2</sub> occurred in the context of iron overload both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, concluding that Mdm2 is the critical mediator that participates in iron overload triggered ER&#x03B1; loss.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates the impact of iron overload in E<sub>2</sub>-mediated ER&#x03B1; proteolysis and its critical consequence on the outcome of HRT. With the efficacy of HRT challenged by &#x201C;the window of opportunity&#x201D; theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yesufu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), it is vital to explore therapies that maintain ER&#x03B1; expression mediating the protective effects of estrogen. Although further work is needed to determine whether iron restriction therapy is clinically relevant in combination with HRT for the intervention of postmenopausal atherosclerosis as a long-term strategy, this paper provides guidance for optimizing the timing HRT intervention and supportive nutrient management.</p>
