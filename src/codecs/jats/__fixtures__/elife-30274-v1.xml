xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Blum et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated c-Myc’ (Lin et al., 2012). Here we report the results. We found overexpression of c-Myc increased total levels of RNA in P493-6 Burkitt’s lymphoma cells; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 3E; Lin et al., 2012), statistical significance and the size of the effect varied between the original study and the two different lots of serum tested in this replication. Digital gene expression analysis for a set of genes was also performed on P493-6 cells before and after c-Myc overexpression. Transcripts from genes that were active before c-Myc induction increased in expression following c-Myc overexpression, similar to the original study (Figure 3F; Lin et al., 2012). Transcripts from genes that were silent before c-Myc induction also increased in expression following c-Myc overexpression, while the original study concluded elevated c-Myc had no effect on silent genes (Figure 3F; Lin et al., 2012). Treating the data as paired, we found a statistically significant increase in gene expression for both active and silent genes upon c-Myc induction, with the change in gene expression greater for active genes compared to silent genes. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>c-Myc</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>This Replication Study has reproduced important parts of the original paper, but it also contains results that are not consistent with some parts of the original paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>) for a 2012 paper by Lin et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2012, Lin et al. reported results that the c-Myc transcription factor, a potent oncogene that is frequently overexpressed in a large percentage of cancers, globally amplifies the expression of actively transcribed genes, opposed to regulating specific target genes. Using the P493-6 cell line, a model for <italic>MYC</italic> activation in Burkitt’s lymphoma, total levels of RNA per cell were reported to increase when c-Myc was highly expressed compared to conditions where c-Myc expression was low. Additionally, active genes in cells with low c-Myc levels were reported to increase in expression upon c-Myc induction, in contrast to genes that were silent under low c-Myc conditions that did not change.</p><p>The Registered Report for the 2012 paper by Lin et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figure 1B and 3E–F), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>). Since that publication there have been additional studies investigating the ability c-Myc to influence the global gene expression output of cells. Similar to Lin et al. other studies have reported c-Myc dependent amplification of cellular RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hart et al., 20152014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>), although this observation was not reported in all biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fagnocchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). It has been suggested c-Myc regulates specific genes that indirectly lead to RNA amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sabò and Amati, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). This has also been suggested of MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duffy et al., 20142015</xref>). The reported differences could be a result of the intrinsic variation between cell lines in maintaining the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trakhtenberg et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, a recent study reported that distinct transcriptional regulation can be accounted for by differences in promoter affinity under different c-Myc expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lorenzin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditional expression of c-Myc in the B-cell line P493-6</title><p>To test the effects of increased levels of c-Myc on gene expression we used the same human P493-6 B cell line of Burkitt’s lymphoma that contains a conditional tetracycline-repressive <italic>MYC</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pajic et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schuhmacher et al., 1999</xref>) as the original study.

For cells maintained in both lots of serum, treatment with tetracycline resulted in a strong decrease in c-Myc protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 3E of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al. (2012)</xref> and used the same extraction method for total RNA quantification, which was described in Protocol 2 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>). Total RNA was isolated from P493-6 cells 0, 1, and 24 hr after tetracycline release and the amount of RNA per 1,000 cells was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that under conditions where c-Myc expression was low (0 hr), there was a mean of 1.55 ng total RNA per 1,000 cells (ng/1 k cells) [n = 3, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.20], which increased to 1.77 ng/1 k cells [n = 3, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.31] when c-Myc expression was high (24 hr), a 1.14 times increase, for serum lot one, which was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.02, <italic>p</italic>=0.347). Serum lot two changed from a mean of 1.57 ng/1 k cells [n = 3, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.21] at 0 hr to 2.25 ng/1 k cells [n = 3, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.19] at 24 hr, a 1.43 times increase, which was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(6 = 5.03, <italic>p</italic>=0.0024). This compares to the original study, which reported a mean of 4.25 ng/1 k cells at 0 hr, which increased to 5.47 ng/1 k cells at 24 hr, a 1.29 times increase in total RNA levels. In both studies there was a minor decrease at 1 hr after tetracycline release when c-Myc levels begin to become detectable. Total RNA per 1,000 cells at 0 hr were much lower in this replication attempt than those reported in the original study, although changes in total RNA levels were in the same direction following c-Myc expression. Similarly, another independent study that measured total RNA from P493-6 cells reported a different level at 0 hr (~3 ng/1 k cells), while also reporting increased levels following c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>). There are multiple possible explanations for these differences, such as variation in RNA expression during cell culture passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hiorns et al., 2004</xref>), low yield of the RNA isolation procedure (e.g. incomplete homogenization), or the high variance associated with manual cell counts using a hemacytometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biggs and Macmillan, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nielson et al., 1991</xref>). To summarize, for this experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the original study and not statistically significant for serum lot one, while statistically significant for serum lot two.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Digital gene expression following c-Myc overexpression</title><p>To test whether c-Myc expression amplifies the existing gene expression program, digital gene expression analysis using the NanoString nCounter platform was performed on a set of genes from multiple functional categories. This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 3F and Table S1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al. (2012)</xref> and described in Protocols 3–4 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>). We quantified mRNA levels/cell of 1369 genes, of which 1212 were the same genes as the 1338 genes interrogated in the original study. We used the same criteria as the original study to classify a gene as silent (expression was less than 0.5 transcript/cell at time 0 hr) or active (more than one transcript/cell at time 0 hr). In cells with low levels of c-Myc (0 hr) there were 708 active genes with a median expression of 4.70, and 580 silent genes with a median expression of 0.032, for serum lot one. For active genes, 75% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr, 68% increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 59% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr upon c-Myc induction. This corresponds to a 1.11, 1.50, and 1.36 times increase in median expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For silent genes, 74% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr, 66% increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 50% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr, corresponding to a 1.19 and 1.13 times increase, and a 0.05 times decrease in median expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Serum lot two gave similar results, although there were variations in the number of genes identified as silent or active as well as the degree of increase among the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This compares to the original study that identified 755 active genes with a median expression of 7.06, and 514 silent genes with a median expression of 0.00 (more than half the silent genes did not have a reported expression value). Active genes in the original study, increased 91% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 96% from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 87% from 1 hr to 24 hr upon c-Myc induction, corresponding to a 1.23, 2.45, and 1.99 times increase in median expression, respectively. Silent genes in the original study, increased 23% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 29% from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 30% from 1 hr to 24 hr, with the median expression unchanged among conditions. In addition, we further examined the extent of overlap of active and silent genes between the original study and this replication attempt. Of the 1212 genes that were interrogated in both studies, 88.8% (603/679) of the active genes we identified in serum lot one were also active in the original study (90.1% (612/679) for serum lot two).

This analysis differed from what was reported in the original study by analyzing the data as paired instead of unpaired. As suggested during peer review of the Registered Report, this is because expression of the same gene, analyzed across different conditions, is not independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>). We performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on active genes comparing expression at 0 hr to 1 hr, 0 hr to 24 hr, and 1 hr to 24 hr, which were statistically significant for cells grown in both lots of serum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The same comparisons were performed on silent genes, which were also statistically significant, with the exception of the silent gene comparison of 1 hr to 24 hr for serum lot one. Considering this was not the test reported in the original study, we conducted these paired analyses on the original data to provide a direct comparison. For both active and silent genes c-Myc induction resulted in statistically significant increases in expression, with the exception of the silent gene comparison from 0 hr to 1 hr (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This is in contrast to the results of the unpaired tests that were reported in the original study where active genes were reported to have a statistically significant increase in expression and silent genes were reported as not statistically significant for all comparisons. We conducted an exploratory unpaired analysis on the replication data for comparison, which resulted in statistically significant differences among the active gene comparisons as well as half of the silent gene comparisons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30274.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Confirmatory statistical tests.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Genes</th><th valign="bottom">Comparison</th><th valign="bottom">Study</th><th valign="bottom">Z value</th><th valign="bottom">P value</th><th valign="bottom">Sample size (n)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Active</td><td valign="top">0 hr vs 1 hr</td><td valign="top">RP:CB Lot 1</td><td valign="top">14.86</td><td valign="top">1.36e-55</td><td valign="top">708</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RP:CB Lot 2</td><td valign="top">11.83</td><td valign="top">2.83e-34</td><td valign="top">719</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al.

So while some aspects, such as the cell line, induction time course, and the method used to measure gene expression were maintained, others were changed at the time of study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>) that could affect results, such as the analytical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silberzahn et al., 2017</xref>) and serum lot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leek et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, other aspects were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as cell line genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kleensang et al., 2016</xref>) or changes in cellular volume that can impact overall transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015</xref>). Whether these or other factors influence the outcomes of this study is open to hypothesizing and further investigation, which is facilitated by direct replications and transparent reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>As described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2015</xref>), we attempted a replication of the experiments reported in Figures 1B and 3E-F of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al.

Three nCounter Reporter CodeSets (nCounter GX Human Immunology Kit, nCounter GX Human Kinase Kit, nCounter Custom CodeSet) encompassing 1369 genes across multiple functional categories were used. Following hybridization, samples were immediately processed with the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, NCT-PREP-120). The count data was collected using the nCounter RCC Collector Worksheet (NanoString Technologies), version 1.6.0 and then positive-, negative-, and housekeeping gene-normalized per nCounter guidelines. Expression for each gene was averaged across the four independent replicate samples. Additionally, for genes that appeared on multiple CodeSets, expression values were averaged together to generate a single value for each gene. A gene was defined as transcriptionally active if its average expression was above one transcript/cell at 0 hr and transcriptionally silent if below 0.5 transcript/cell.

Proposed analysis of gene expression data was conducted by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test using the method proposed by Pratt to handle zero differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pratt, 1959</xref>), with additional exploratory analysis performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test as reported in the original study and a Wilcoxon rank sum test on the difference in expression of active genes during c-Myc induction (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr) compared to the difference in expression of silent genes over that same period (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr). Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met. When described in the results, the Bonferroni correction, to account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error by dividing the uncorrected value (.05) by the number of tests performed. Although the Bonferroni method is conservative, it was accounted for in the power calculations to ensure sample size was sufficient. In cases where the number of groups were three and the sample sizes were evenly distributed among the groups, Fisher's LSD test was performed resulting in an <italic>a priori</italic> significance threshold of. 05.

The proposed statistical analysis for the western blot analysis (Protocol 1) described in the Registered Report was not performed since the levels of normalized c-Myc at time 0 hr was at the limit of detection. The number of genes analyzed in the original study, and thus listed in the Registered Report, was reported incorrectly as 1388 instead of 1338 (data shared by original authors). NanoString analysis was conducted using the nCounter RCC Collector Worksheet instead of nSolver Analysis software. Additionally, the statistical tests reported in Figure 3F of the original study incorrectly described the comparisons as between 0 hr and 1 hr instead of between 0 hr and 24 hr (scripts shared by original authors).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Green as the Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The two reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lewis et al. performed reproducibility experiments for key data of the paper published by Lin et al. 2012 in Cell. In particular, the experiment described in Figure 1B and its bioinformatic analysis in Figure 3E, F were investigated for reproducibility. Lin et al. studied the change of mRNA levels in response to up-regulated levels of c-Myc in the human B cell line P493-6, which carries a conditional tetracycline-regulated c-Myc gene (Tet-off system). Lin et al. reported that the increase of c-Myc levels in P493-6 cells (after removal of tetracyline) was not sufficient to induce expression of silent genes. In contrast, mRNA levels of those genes, which were expressed already before c-Myc induction, were further elevated. However, the data of Lin et al. (Figure 3F) already showed that this general statement is not valid for all silent genes. Several silent genes (per definition less the 0.5 transcripts/cell) showed elevated mRNA levels (up to 20 transcripts/cell) 24h after c-Myc induction. Importantly, the group of silent genes analyzed in the study of Lin et al. was relatively small (only 514 genes) and randomly selected. If all silent genes in P493-6 cells were analyzed in this study (probably many thousands), the group of silent genes with up-regulated mRNA levels would probably be much larger (hundreds of genes). Thus, the analysis of the data in Figure 3F suffers from the definition of gene sets. The statement of the paper that silent genes are not inducible by c-Myc comes mainly from the fact that the set of analyzed silent genes is very small.</p><p>The replication work of Lewis et al. largely confirms the results of Lin et al. (Figure 1B, Figure 3E,F) and shows that elevation of c-Myc levels also elevates the mRNA levels of the same set of genes (potential c-Myc target genes). However, the study of Lewis et al. shows in addition that a larger number of silent genes is inducible by c-Myc and that the rate of induction of c-Myc target genes is generally influenced by the applied serum batch/lot.</p><p>Both studies, Lin et al. and Lewis et al., did not address or discuss the question to which extent the increase in mRNA levels is caused by post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p><p>For the scientific community two questions are of general (high) interest: How does the entire transcriptome of P493-6 cells respond to increased c-Myc levels and how do all the silent genes respond, neither of which were analyzed in this study?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper of Lin et al. led to a great controversy in the c-Myc field, including the labs of Martin Eilers and Bruno Amati, because it ignored that c-Myc also activates inactive genes and represses active genes. Both labs published 2014 two papers back to back in Nature correcting this biased view of the Lin paper. The biased view of the Lin paper is the result of the definition of small genes sets for the analysis and this issue needs to be explicitly discussed in the reproducibility study.</p><p>2) Expression levels of c-Myc are much lower than those of the original study, although the changes of c-Myc expression are in the same direction as the original study (subsection “Total RNA levels following c-Myc overexpression”). Can the authors please discuss this issue?</p><p>3) In this study, 580 silent genes were identified with expression level less than 0.5 transcript/cell with a median expression of 0.032. In the original study, 514 genes were identified as silent genes with a median expression of 0.00. If I understand correctly, the current study uses different criteria for a gene to be classified as silent gene. I am curious whether there is a rationale for using 0.5 transcript/cell as the cutoff. In addition, it would be interesting to know how many silent genes are common between the two studies, and how many active genes are common between the two studies (subsection “Digital gene expression following c-Myc overexpression”, first paragraph). The extent of overlap of genes might play a role on some of the inconsistent results between two studies, as mentioned in the meta analysis section (subsection “Meta-analyses of original and replicated effects”, last two paragraphs).</p><p>4) The authors should make a R package with a R markdown file and all the associated data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30274.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper of Lin et al. led to a great controversy in the c-Myc field, including the labs of Martin Eilers and Bruno Amati, because it ignored that c-Myc also activates inactive genes and represses active genes.

We also agree that dichotomizing gene expression (which is a continuous variable) into active and silent genes has additional negative consequences. We have expanded the manuscript to discuss these issues and are including additional supplemental figures that present the gene expression results on a continuous scale, instead of only segmented into silent and active genes. Thus, while this replication study is prone to the small gene set, due to replicating the design of the original study, the additional figures provide additional means to assess the impact c-Myc induction has on gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Expression levels of c-Myc are much lower than those of the original study, although the changes of c-Myc expression are in the same direction as the original study (subsection “Total RNA levels following c-Myc overexpression”).

We have expanded the section highlighted to discuss some potential factors that might account for this difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In this study, 580 silent genes were identified with expression level less than 0.5 transcript/cell with a median expression of 0.032.

The reason for the different number of genes, as well as the median expression at time 0 hr, is because the original study reported a majority of the silent genes as having an expression of 0.00 transcript/cell. We have revised the text to clearly state that the same criteria were used. We are not aware of what the rationale is for using these cutoffs, as it was not included in the original study. As stated above in response to comment 1, there are also negative consequences of dichotomizing continuous variables. To provide another means of displaying the data, we included additional supplement figures to illustrate the distribution of gene expression of all genes analyzed at the different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We agree that the extent of overlap of genes between the two studies (and the two lots tested in this replication attempt) are of interest. We analyzed what percent of genes were common between the different studies for active and silent genes and have included this in the revised manuscript. There was 88.8% commonality for active genes between serum lot one in this replication attempt and the original study (90.1% for serum lot two) with 96.4% commonality for silent genes between serum lot one in this replication attempt and the original study (95.7% for serum lot two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should make a R package with a R markdown file and all the associated data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that sharing the Rmd file and associated scripts and data are important. We used the OSF to create a project that stores all files/scripts/methods associated with this study and have a function so the associated data and scripts are downloaded when knitting the Rmd file. This will work now while the project is private as well as when the project, with all the associated files, is made public. The location of the Rmd file is also included in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/vdrsh/">https://osf.io/vdrsh/</ext-link>) and we’ve included it as a ‘Source code file’ during resubmission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
