        G-quadruplexes (G4) are alternative nucleic acid structures involved in
        transcription, translation and replication. Aberrant G4 formation and
        stabilisation is linked to genome instability and cancer. G4 ligand
        treatment disrupts key biological processes leading to cell death. To
        discover genes and pathways involved with G4s and gain mechanistic
        insights into G4 biology, we present the first unbiased genome-wide
        study to systematically identify human genes that promote cell death
        when silenced by shRNA in the presence of G4-stabilising small
        molecules. Many novel genetic vulnerabilities were revealed opening up
        new therapeutic possibilities in cancer, which we exemplified by an
        orthogonal pharmacological inhibition approach that phenocopies gene
        silencing. We find that targeting the WEE1 cell cycle kinase or USP1
        deubiquitinase in combination with G4 ligand treatment enhances cell
        killing. We also identify new genes and pathways regulating or
        interacting with G4s and demonstrate that the DDX42 DEAD-box helicase is
        a newly discovered G4-binding protein.

        promoters and 5â UTRs of highly transcribed genes, including
        cancer-related genes and regions of somatic copy number alteration. G4s
        may therefore be part of a regulatory mechanism to switch between
        different transcriptional states. At telomeres, tandem G4-repeat
        structures also may help protect chromosome ends by providing binding

Two general outcomes are possible: a gene is not required in a G4-dependent process so there is no effect on cell viability\_(left); or gene silencing results in cell death either due to loss of a direct G4 interaction (e.g. binding/unwinding) or indirectly through gene loss in a G4-dependent pathway\_(right).

        An unbiased genome-wide shRNA screen was performed in A375 human
        melanoma cells to globally evaluate genetic vulnerabilities to
        G4-ligands and to identify genes and pathways involved with
        G4-structures (

        To enable more rigorous and further comparative analyses that focus

This panel consisted of a single retroviral shRNA pool to allow all shRNAs to be screened simultaneously under standardised conditions and to minimise technical fluctuations. We first used this panel to recapitulate the findings of the genome-wide screen above and compare responses with different G4 ligands. Using A375 melanoma cells with PDS and PhenDC3, the custom panel recovered a total of 342 G4 sensitisers corresponding to 40.6% overlap (308 genes) with the complete genome-wide screen ("

        Overall, these results clearly show the spectrum of biological
        vulnerabilities that underpin the observed enhanced sensitivities for
        each G4-targeting ligand.

        We next sought to extend the use of the custom shRNA lentiviral library
        to gain initial insights into possible commonalities and differences in
        the response to G4 ligands in cells from different lineages. We
        therefore applied the custom library to mesenchymal-derived HT1080

        potentiation of growth inhibition, albeit at lower compound
        concentrations, for PDS/MK1775 and PDS/pimozide drug combinations for

        can synergistical act as a surrogate for gene deficiencies in the
        presence of G4 ligands and thus complements the findings uncovered by
        our genetic screening approach.

        independent cell lines, (HT1080, HEK293 and HeLa). As controls for

        potentiate G4 ligand effects has yet to be defined. Here, we have
        discovered many genes that when depleted enhance cell killing with the
        G4 ligands PDS and/or PhenDC3. The majority of these have no documented
        link to G4 biology and the use of low ligand concentrations is likely to
        favour discovery of gene losses that are the most sensitive in imparting
        selective cell killing. Validating the success of our approach, we
        independently identified G4-associated protein coding genes known to be
        genetic vulnerabilities to G4 ligands including

        known G4-associated genes that promote sensitivity to G4-stabilising
        ligands. These include direct nucleic acid binders and/or unwinders,

        In dropout screens, dissociating minor from robust growth effects is
        important and is highly dependent on parameters such as compound dose,
        genotype and cell line selected. Our screen was designed with stringent
        parameters to detect genes deficiencies worthy of further exploration.
        Indeed, we demonstrate potent growth inhibition of up to 80% of the four
        top G4 sensitisers genes in a parallel siRNA approach.

        The gene sensitivities uncovered here have potential to be exploited
        chemotherapeutically in cancer by deploying a G4-stabilising drug as a
        single-agent therapy. Alternatively, in the absence of a particular gene
        deficiency, pharmacological inhibition of a critical oncogene could
        phenocopy the genetic sensitivities described here and be used in
        combinatorial treatments with G4-stabilising drugs. This may be
        attractive as cells are less likely to simultaneously develop resistance
        against two drugs (reviewed in

        ). Furthermore, as lower drug doses are used, this increases the
        therapeutic window and has less adverse side effects. As
        proof-as-principle for this, we selected the WEE1 cell cycle kinase and
        the deubiquitinase USP1, and demonstrated that their pharmacological
        inhibition, with MK1775 and pimozide, respectively, leads to the
        potentiation of cell death in conjunction with the G4 ligand PDS. For
        example, 5.3 Î¼M PDS or 6.25 Î¼M pimozide alone impart little growth
        inhibition (14% and 6% respectively), but together they lead to strong
        growth inhibition (79%).

Differences in individual ligand sensitives may arise from variances in cellular uptake and dose, for\_example, the GI20 dose of PhenDC3 is ten-fold higher for A375 compared to HT1080; G4 ligand-dependent molecular preference for G-tetrad end binding ("

        especially in A375 cells, may contribute to the differences in G4 ligand
        growth inhibition in our siRNA experiments. In the siRNA experiments,
        the G4 ligand-induced growth inhibition of both A375 and HT1080 appear
        not to follow a âtypicalâ dose response where higher concentrations lead
        to greater effects. This may in part be due to there being an optimum G4
        ligand dose for a particular gene loss leading to enhanced cell death.
        Indeed, it is thought that lower drug concentrations better fall within
        a âsynthetic lethality windowâ (

DNA-Seq libraries were prepared from these samples using the NextSeq Illumina Platform v2 High Output Kit 75 cycles, followed by 36 base pair single-read sequencing performed on an Illumina NextSeq instrument, using a custom sequencing primer."

        Gene Ontology terms (Biological Process and Molecular Function) for
        significantly depleted genes upon G4 ligand treatment. Specifically, a
        right-sided (Enrichment) test based on the hyper-geometric distribution
        was performed on the corresponding Entrez gene IDs for each gene list
        and the Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.05) was applied to correct for

        IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP) were used. The Kappa-statistics score threshold was
        set to 0.4 and GO term fusion was used to diminish redundancy of terms
        shared by similar proteins. Other parameters include: GO level intervals
        (3â8 genes) and Group Merge (50%). Protein domains were investigated
        using DAVID (v6.8) to integrate GENE3D crystallographic data and PFAM

Cells were transfected with either targeting or non-targeting control siRNAs using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 13778150) and OptiMEM reduced serum medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturerâs protocol (reagent protocol 2013) alongside a non-transfected control. 24 hr after transfection, cells were trypsinised, counted and re-plated in media supplemented with PDS, PhenDC3 or DMSO vehicle control (minimum two biological replicates per condition) in a 48-well plate format (seeding density - 8,000 cells per well A375; 4,000 cells per well HT1080). Cell growth was monitored for 144 hr using IncuCyteZOOM live cell analysis (Sartorius) and cell confluency calculated as a percentage of the well area covered. Scans were performed every 3 hr; nine scans per well. To monitor protein levels, cells transfected simultaneously with the same siRNA-reagent mixture were harvested 48 hr and 144 hr after transfection, by cell scraping and lysed on ice (30 min) with RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitor\_+EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 8990). Lysates were analysed by capillary electrophoresis via the Protein Simple Wes platform according to manufacturerâs protocol with antibodies summarised in the key resource table above. Lysates from non-transfected and siRNA-treated (targeting and non-targeting) samples were probed with antibodies against BRCA1 (Cell Signalling Technology, cat # 4970-CST), TOP1 (Abcam, cat # AB109374), GAR1 (NovusBio cat #NBP2-31742) or DDX42 (Abcam cat #AB80975), plus anti-beta actin antibody (mouse Merck cat # A5441; rabbit cat # 4970-CST) by multiplexing. For non-targeting and targeting lysates, the area of the desired band was normalised to beta-actin and then normalised to the protein level in the non-targeting sample, for three (48 hr after transfection lysates) or two independent Wes runs (144 hr after transfection). Protein depletion is expressed as an average of these normalised values. All lysates were used at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL and antibody dilutions as follows: BRCA1 1:50; TOP1 1:250; GAR1 1:100; DDX42 1:250; rabbit-actin 1:500; mouse-actin 1:250."
