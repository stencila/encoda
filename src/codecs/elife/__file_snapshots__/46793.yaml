        G-quadruplex secondary structures (G4s) form in nucleic acids through
        the self-association of guanines (G) in G-rich sequences to form stacked
        tetrad structures (reviewed in

        ). Sequences encoding G4s are enriched in regulatory regions consistent
        with roles in transcription and RNA regulation (

      - target: '#bib88'

        ). In the transcriptome, more than 3000 mRNAs have been shown to contain
        G4 structures in vitro, particularly at 5’ and 3’ UTRs, suggestive of
        roles in posttranscriptional regulation (

        human stomach and liver cancers compared to non-neoplastic tissues,
        supporting an association between G4 structures and cancer (

        formation in chromatin revealing a link between G4s, promoters and
        transcription (
      - target: '#bib54'
        type: Cite

        ). G4s are found predominately in nucleosome-depleted chromatin within
        promoters and 5’ UTRs of highly transcribed genes, including
        cancer-related genes and regions of somatic copy number alteration. G4s
        may therefore be part of a regulatory mechanism to switch between
        different transcriptional states. At telomeres, tandem G4-repeat
        structures also may help protect chromosome ends by providing binding
        sites for shelterin complex components (reviewed in 
      - target: '#bib16'

        ). As G4 structures can pause or stall polymerases, they must be
        resolved by helicases to allow replication and transcription to proceed.
        Several helicases, including WRN, BLM, PIF1, DHX36 and RTEL1, have been
        shown to unwind G4-structures in vitro (

        syndrome patients, who are predisposed to cancer, show altered gene
        expression that correlates with sites with potential to form G4s (

        Small molecules that selectively bind and stabilise G4 formation in
        vitro have been used to probe G4 biological function. G4 ligands, such
        as pyridostatin (PDS), PhenDC3 and TMPyP4, can reduce transcription of
        many genes harbouring a promoter G4, including oncogenes such as

        ). G4-stabilising ligands also interfere with telomere homeostasis by
        inducing telomere uncapping/DNA damage through the inhibition of
        telomere extension by telomerase leading to senescence or apoptosis
        (reviewed in 
      - target: '#bib88'

        oncogene translation (

Cells are infected with a genome-wide pool of shRNA lentiviruses targeting the protein coding genome followed by G4 ligand treatment to stabilise genomic and/or RNA G4 structures. Two general outcomes are possible: a gene is not required in a G4-dependent process so there is no effect on cell viability\_(left); or gene silencing results in cell death either due to loss of a direct G4 interaction (e.g. binding/unwinding) or indirectly through gene loss in a G4-dependent pathway\_(right). In absence of ligand, cells are viable in presence of the shRNA. Dotted boxes highlight genotypes of disease significance for possible G4-based therapies (blue) and genes and biological pathways that involve and/or interact with G4 structures (orange)."

This panel consisted of a single retroviral shRNA pool to allow all shRNAs to be screened simultaneously under standardised conditions and to minimise technical fluctuations. We first used this panel to recapitulate the findings of the genome-wide screen above and compare responses with different G4 ligands. Using A375 melanoma cells with PDS and PhenDC3, the custom panel recovered a total of 342 G4 sensitisers corresponding to 40.6% overlap (308 genes) with the complete genome-wide screen ("

        Overall, these results clearly show the spectrum of biological
        vulnerabilities that underpin the observed enhanced sensitivities for
        each G4-targeting ligand.

        We next reasoned that the robust set of 290 G4 ligand sensitiser genes
        above provides a suitable test bed for exploring the arising therapeutic
        potential for combinatorial pharmacological inhibition and G4-ligands.
        We therefore looked for the presence of these sensitisers genes within
        the druggable genome interaction database (DGIdb) (

        ). A total of 74 G4-sensitisers were found in the classifications
        ‘Druggable Genome’ (genes with known or predicted drug interactions) and
        ‘Clinically Actionable’ (genes used in targeted clinical cancer
        sequencing for precision medicine) with 13 being common to both
        classifications (

        and highlights a new therapeutic domain for the application of G4-based
        drugs. Performing a similar analysis on the 40 most robust sensitisers
        common to both G4 ligands gave 12 genes within DGIdb (

        Another of our aims was to use the findings of our shRNA screen to
        identify proteins that may bind and/or regulate G4 structures in cells,
        such as G4 helicases. Indeed, DHX36 and DHX9, known G4 helicases (

        G4s (

        the DDX/DHX helicase family also appeared as G4 sensitisers (

        ), raising the question of whether these represent previously
        uncharacterized G4-binding proteins. To address this directly, we chose
        to investigate DDX42 as this was one of the four key G4 sensitisers
        identified above. DDX42 is a non-processive RNA helicase (

        ), we first established that DDX42 predominantly localises to the
        nucleus (~4 to 9-fold greater than cytoplasmic levels) in three
        independent cell lines, (HT1080, HEK293 and HeLa). As controls for
        fractionation, LaminB1 and GAPDH were found to partition as expected
        into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively (

While PDS and PhenDC3 have not been optimised by medicinal chemistry, the findings of Zimmer et al showing similar efficacy of PDS and olaparib in several BRCA-deficient models ("

        In dropout screens, dissociating minor from robust growth effects is
        important and is highly dependent on parameters such as compound dose,
        genotype and cell line selected. Our screen was designed with stringent
        parameters to detect genes deficiencies worthy of further exploration.
        Indeed, we demonstrate potent growth inhibition of up to 80% of the four
        top G4 sensitisers genes in a parallel siRNA approach.

        The gene sensitivities uncovered here have potential to be exploited
        chemotherapeutically in cancer by deploying a G4-stabilising drug as a
        single-agent therapy. Alternatively, in the absence of a particular gene
        deficiency, pharmacological inhibition of a critical oncogene could
        phenocopy the genetic sensitivities described here and be used in
        combinatorial treatments with G4-stabilising drugs. This may be
        attractive as cells are less likely to simultaneously develop resistance
        against two drugs (reviewed in 
      - target: '#bib24'
        type: Cite

        ). Furthermore, as lower drug doses are used, this increases the
        therapeutic window and has less adverse side effects. As
        proof-as-principle for this, we selected the WEE1 cell cycle kinase and
        the deubiquitinase USP1, and demonstrated that their pharmacological
        inhibition, with MK1775 and pimozide, respectively, leads to the
        potentiation of cell death in conjunction with the G4 ligand PDS. For
        example, 5.3 μM PDS or 6.25 μM pimozide alone impart little growth
        inhibition (14% and 6% respectively), but together they lead to strong
        growth inhibition (79%).

      - "While the custom HT1080 screen recovered 58% of sensitisers seen for each ligand in the A375 genome-wide screen, it is striking that this increases to 93% (i.e. 112 out of 121) when considering all screens irrespective of G4 ligand, suggesting remarkable consistency when comparing G4 ligand effects globally. Differences in individual ligand sensitives may arise from variances in cellular uptake and dose, for\_example, the GI20 dose of PhenDC3 is ten-fold higher for A375 compared to HT1080; G4 ligand-dependent molecular preference for G-tetrad end binding ("

        lines (
      - target: '#bib54'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ). These points plus differences in protein knockdown efficiency,
        especially in A375 cells, may contribute to the differences in G4 ligand
        growth inhibition in our siRNA experiments. In the siRNA experiments,
        the G4 ligand-induced growth inhibition of both A375 and HT1080 appear
        not to follow a ‘typical’ dose response where higher concentrations lead
        to greater effects. This may in part be due to there being an optimum G4
        ligand dose for a particular gene loss leading to enhanced cell death.
        Indeed, it is thought that lower drug concentrations better fall within
        a ‘synthetic lethality window’ (
      - target: '#bib93'
        type: Cite
      - >-
        ). Higher doses may mask these effects, by targeting more G4s that are
        not dependent on the particular gene lost and/or be due to other
        off-target effects. This is also supported by the experiments in

        In conclusion, we have revealed genes and pathways that interact with
        stabilised G4 structures. This information provides new insights into
        G4-related biology, especially into the functional pathways and roles as

        disease-related genetic vulnerabilities for G4-ligands. Overall, these
        data provide a unique and comprehensive resource that can be further
        explored to understand biology that may involve G4s and also inspire new
        therapeutic possibilities.

        Gene Ontology terms (Biological Process and Molecular Function) for
        significantly depleted genes upon G4 ligand treatment. Specifically, a
        right-sided (Enrichment) test based on the hyper-geometric distribution
        was performed on the corresponding Entrez gene IDs for each gene list
        and the Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.05) was applied to correct for
        multiple hypothesis testing. Only experimental evidence codes (EXP, IDA,
        IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP) were used. The Kappa-statistics score threshold was
        set to 0.4 and GO term fusion was used to diminish redundancy of terms
        shared by similar proteins. Other parameters include: GO level intervals
        (3–8 genes) and Group Merge (50%). Protein domains were investigated
        using DAVID (v6.8) to integrate GENE3D crystallographic data and PFAM
        sequence information and enrichment was considered significant if the

      - "ON-TARGETplus siRNAs (Dharmacon/GE healthcare) were used as summarised in the table below. Cells were transfected with either targeting or non-targeting control siRNAs using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 13778150) and OptiMEM reduced serum medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (reagent protocol 2013) alongside a non-transfected control. 24 hr after transfection, cells were trypsinised, counted and re-plated in media supplemented with PDS, PhenDC3 or DMSO vehicle control (minimum two biological replicates per condition) in a 48-well plate format (seeding density - 8,000 cells per well A375; 4,000 cells per well HT1080). Cell growth was monitored for 144 hr using IncuCyteZOOM live cell analysis (Sartorius) and cell confluency calculated as a percentage of the well area covered. Scans were performed every 3 hr; nine scans per well. To monitor protein levels, cells transfected simultaneously with the same siRNA-reagent mixture were harvested 48 hr and 144 hr after transfection, by cell scraping and lysed on ice (30 min) with RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitor\_+EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 8990). Lysates were analysed by capillary electrophoresis via the Protein Simple Wes platform according to manufacturer’s protocol with antibodies summarised in the key resource table above. Lysates from non-transfected and siRNA-treated (targeting and non-targeting) samples were probed with antibodies against BRCA1 (Cell Signalling Technology, cat # 4970-CST), TOP1 (Abcam, cat # AB109374), GAR1 (NovusBio cat #NBP2-31742) or DDX42 (Abcam cat #AB80975), plus anti-beta actin antibody (mouse Merck cat # A5441; rabbit cat # 4970-CST) by multiplexing. For non-targeting and targeting lysates, the area of the desired band was normalised to beta-actin and then normalised to the protein level in the non-targeting sample, for three (48 hr after transfection lysates) or two independent Wes runs (144 hr after transfection). Protein depletion is expressed as an average of these normalised values. All lysates were used at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL and antibody dilutions as follows: BRCA1 1:50; TOP1 1:250; GAR1 1:100; DDX42 1:250; rabbit-actin 1:500; mouse-actin 1:250."

        Bioscience, cat# CAY21266) and pimozide (Merck, cat# P1793-500MG) were
        used as for synergy experiment. Cells were seeded in Corning, Tissue
        Culture-treated 96-well clear bottom plates (Thermofisher,
        cat#07-200-587) for HT1080 (1000 cells per well) and A375 (1500 cells
        per well) cell lines. 24 hr after plating, media was removed and cells
        were treated with different concentrations of PDS and MK1775 or pimozide
        in media in a final volume of 150 μL, alongside non-treated and
        solvent-treated controls. After 96 hr, cell death was determined via a
        CellTitre-Glo One Solution assay (Promega, cat # G8461) according to
        manufacturer’s protocol using the PHERAstar FS (BMG labtech) to detect
        luminescence, using the recommended settings. Values were normalised to
        and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls. This was
        performed for three biological replicas. Data were analysed via
        Combenefit software using the BLISS independence model since the
        molecule have independent targets (

        (300 cells per well) and HT1080 (400 cells per well) were plated as
        single cells in 12-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with
        DMSO or the indicated doses of PDS, pimozide and/or MK1775 in media.
        After 8 days, colonies were fixed with 3% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for
        90 min at 4°C, washed with MiliQ, air dried and then stained with 0.057%
        (v/v) Sulforhodamine B solution (Merck, cat # 230162–5G) for 30 min at
        room temperature. Plates were then washed four times with 1% acetic
        acid, air dried and colonies visualised using GelCount (Oxford
        Optronix). Colony growth was determined using the ‘colony intensity
        percentage’ parameter in the ColonyArea Image J plugin (
