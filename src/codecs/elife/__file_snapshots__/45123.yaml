        Most of the mammalian genome does not encode for working proteins.
        However, much of this non-coding DNA is still transcribed, often to
        produce RNA products that have a role in development. Some of these
        molecules are called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) because they contain
        more than 200 base pairs: these transcripts fine-tune gene expression by
        interacting with chromatin and the transcription machinery inside cells

        Ang et al. started by reprogramming mouse cells called embryonic
        fibroblasts into neurons; this experiment helped them to identify 35
        candidate lncRNAs that are both upregulated when neurons form and close
        to neuronal genes. Amongst those, 28 were present on the same
        chromosomes in humans and in mice. The group then tried to identify
        whether these 28 human candidates were mutated in disease by overlapping
        the lncRNAs sequences onto a map of mutations found in children with
        neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital defects. This analysis
        highlighted five lncRNAs that were often mutated in affected
        individuals, and which happened to also be expressed during human brain
        development. One of them, called

        How mutations in protein-coding genes contribute to disease is widely
        studied, yet most mutations are found in regions that do not code for
        proteins. Understanding how lncRNAs regulate genes during brain
        development provides a way to tie genetic variation with changes in gene
        expression in neurodevelopmental disorders. Building on the findings by
        Ang et al., it may be possible to examine how clinical phenotypes,
        cellular responses and lncRNAs are connected in these conditions,
        potential unearthing new targets for therapeutic intervention.
