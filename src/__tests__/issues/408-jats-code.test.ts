 * See https://github.com/stencila/encoda/issues/408

 * The issue was that, although we have decoding of `<code>` elements, a `CodeBlock`
 * was getting generated and because that is block content within a `Paragraph`
 * it got 'inlined' (i.e just it's string contents taken). That bug was addressed (for
 * `MathBlock`) with 7da0ef9f181c0ff1dbdfefb76d0dadf0da384bb9. This is a
 * regression test.
